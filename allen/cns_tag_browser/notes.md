 This activity taught me that the simplest way of describing a person or place is usually the most common way stories are tagged. For example, there are more tags for "Donald Trump" than for "President Donald Trump," and more for "Baltimore" than "Baltimore City." 

 
I wouldn’t want someone to have to search through 1,000 tags just to find a topic. I think it would be really cool to have a "filter" button that lists all the available topics. That way, the person could easily sort through the tags. All the topics within the tags should be displayed clearly and up front. By default, the tags could be organized into categories like people, places, and important things. I think the filter feature should group tags based on the themes they fall under, that’s something I’d really like to see.

Reflection: 
At first, I asked Copilot in the simplest way possible: “Create a basic website that loads tags.json and displays all the tags in a searchable, sortable list.” I also mentioned the styles I wanted, but when I saw the result, the site looked very plain—basically no color or design. So I told it to make the tags more user-friendly, and it updated the style.css file, which definitely looked better than the first version.

Next, I asked it to create a separate section for popular tags, and I thought it was pretty cool that it could do that so easily. I also wanted the sort and filter options to be improved, so I gave it some more specific instructions, and it responded really well. Later, I was curious to see what suggestions Copilot would come up with on its own. Some of its ideas included adding color, clickable tags, showing tag descriptions, using a responsive grid layout, displaying the total number of tags, and more. I ended up using most of its suggestions related to style and organization.

One thing I found interesting was that Copilot could pull from any file in the project’s data folder without me having to paste the entire dataset, it just knew where to look. I was also surprised (in a good way) at how it would jump between different parts of the site’s design and explain which part of the code it was editing whenever I gave it a new prompt.

If I were to do this again, I’d probably change my approach. Instead of giving it so many detailed guidelines upfront, I’d be curious to see what it would come up with if I just gave it the data and asked it to build a website. Would it organize the tags like I imagined? Would it add images or other features I didn’t think of?

Copoilot Conversation: 
Mauriah1: create a file called test.html with your name as a header, maybe using the tag, and serve it using a simple Python server.

GitHub Copilot: Created [](file:///workspaces/jour329w_fall2025/test.html)

Ran terminal command: python3 -m http.server 8000

The file test.html has been created with my name as a header. A simple Python HTTP server is now running and serving the file on port 8000. You can view it by opening your browser and navigating to http://localhost:8000/test.html.

Made changes.

Mauriah1: Create a simple website that loads tags.json and displays all the tags in a searchable, sortable list.

Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The data source should be tags.json, which has fields like name and count.

Show each tag’s name and its count in a table or grid.

Add a search bar so users can filter tags in real time.

Make the table sortable by count (default: descending).

Keep the CSS clean, readable, and mobile-friendly.

Put HTML in index.html, styles in styles.css, and the logic in app.js.

Don’t hardcode the tags — load them dynamically from the JSON file.

Mauriah1: this is not the style i want my website i want it to simpliy show a way to view the CNS tags in a user-friendly-way

GitHub Copilot: Created [](file:///workspaces/jour329w_fall2025/index.html)

Created [](file:///workspaces/jour329w_fall2025/styles.css)

Created [](file:///workspaces/jour329w_fall2025/app.js)

Ran terminal command: python3 -m http.server 8000

Your new website is ready! It loads `tags.json` dynamically and displays the CNS tags in a clean, user-friendly, searchable, and sortable list. The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are separated as requested.

To view it, open your browser to http://localhost:8000/index.html (make sure only one Python server is running on port 8000). If you see a port error, stop any previous server and try again. Let me know if you want to adjust the style or add more features!

Made changes.

The website now displays a "Popular Tags" section at the top, showing the top 5 most popular tags (by count) above the searchable list. The style remains clean and user-friendly. Reload the site to see the update! Let me know if you want to customize how popular tags are shown.

Made changes.

Mauriah1: okay does it have a sort feature and and filter feature can you tell me what you suggest

GitHub Copilot: Yes, your website already has a filter feature: the search bar lets users filter tags in real time by name.

For sorting, the tags are always shown in descending order by count (most popular first), both in the main list and the popular tags section. However, there is no UI for users to change the sort order (e.g., sort by name or ascending count).

**Suggestions to improve usability:**
1. Add clickable column headers or buttons to let users sort by:
   - Tag name (A-Z or Z-A)
   - Count (ascending or descending)
2. Show the current sort order visually (e.g., with an arrow or highlight).
3. Optionally, allow filtering by minimum count or other criteria.

Would you like me to add a sort UI so users can choose how to sort the tags? If so, which sort options do you want: by name, by count, or both?

Mauriah1: yes 

GitHub Copilot: Using "Apply Patch"


```

```

```

```

```

```
A sort UI has been added! Users can now sort tags by count (high→low, low→high) or by name (A→Z, Z→A) using a dropdown above the tag list. The search filter and sort work together for a better browsing experience. Reload your site to see the new features in action!

Made changes.

Mauriah1: can you make sure the website is running properly

GitHub Copilot: Ran terminal command: python3 -m http.server 8000

The website is now being served at http://localhost:8000/. You can open this URL in your browser to verify that the site is running properly, including the search and sort features. Let me know if you encounter any issues or need further adjustments!

Mauriah1: okay wonderful do you suggest anything else to make this a more viusal presentation and user friendly?

GitHub Copilot: Here are some suggestions to make your tag viewer more visual and user-friendly:

1. **Add tag colors or badges:** Assign random or category-based colors to tag names for quick visual distinction.
2. **Clickable tags:** Make each tag clickable to show more info, filter posts, or link to its page.
3. **Show tag descriptions:** If available, display a short description or tooltip on hover.
4. **Responsive grid option:** Let users toggle between a list and a grid view for tags.
5. **Tag cloud:** Offer a “cloud” view where more popular tags appear larger.
6. **Animated transitions:** Add subtle animations when filtering or sorting tags.
7. **Show total tags and results count:** Display the number of tags and filtered results.
8. **Accessibility improvements:** Ensure good color contrast, keyboard navigation, and ARIA labels.

Would you like to implement any of these features? If so, let me know which one(s) you want to add!

Mauriah1: 1,2,3,7,8

Your tag viewer now includes these improvements:
- Tags have colorful badges for quick visual distinction.
- Tags are clickable and open their link in a new tab.
- Tag descriptions (if available) show as tooltips on hover.
- The total number of tags and filtered results is displayed.
- Accessibility is improved: tags are keyboard-navigable and have ARIA labels.
