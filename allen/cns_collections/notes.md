CNS Collections - Baltimore 

My chosen topic to cover was Baltimore, there are 64 stories that surround this topic. 
 
For the story schema, I decided to keep People, Geographic Focus, Key Institutions, and Beat-Specific Field as categories. However, I added Story Type because I was interested in seeing what kinds of stories were being produced within this beat.

Using facets and filters, I found it particularly interesting that most of the stories were feature stories. This surprised me, as I initially associated Baltimore coverage with crime or government policy. When exploring the People filter, I noticed that many individuals appeared only once—likely because many of the stories highlighted local community members. Those who appeared more than once tended to be public figures such as Governor Wes Moore or Mayor Brandon Scott. The only other recurring names were people who were either high-profile figures involved in legal trouble or individuals whose passing made the news.

Most stories focused on Baltimore City, which helped explain why I didn’t see as many crime-related stories as I expected. Baltimore City, while urban, has areas that don’t always align with the city’s actual reality. 

The Institutional Networks filter didn’t reveal much that stood out for this particular beat.

Beat Book Evaluation
The structured metadata revealed that this beat isn’t about all of Baltimore, it specifically emphasizes Baltimore City. It also shows that the organization covers more than just politics, it highlights community life and local storytelling. My biggest takeaway was that this beat features a lot of human-centered and community-oriented stories, because this is something I did not think it covered much before. 

The prototype.md file was somewhat helpful in understanding what kinds of stories a reporter might cover within this beat. However, it didn’t provide much insight into how those stories were written—for example, what kinds of hooks were used or what motivated the subjects. The beatbook currently reads more like a list of bullet points than a narrative summary.

I didn’t change the prompt this time, but with more time, I definitely would. I’d like to see whether an LLM could identify the types of narrative techniques used—such as hooks or framing devices. I also wannted to see if it would  provide richer explanations that could help someone new to Maryland understand the context of these stories more deeply.
