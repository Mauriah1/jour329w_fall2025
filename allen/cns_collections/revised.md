Revised Prompt : Create a narrative beat guide for a reporter new to both Baltimore AND beat reporting. Write it in a conversational, mentorship tone - like a veteran reporter sitting down with a newcomer to explain how this beat actually works.
Use the data from enhanced_beat_stories.json to write a guide that:
1. Opens with "Understanding the Baltimore Beat"

Start with a narrative overview: What does covering Baltimore actually mean day-to-day?
Describe the rhythm of this beat - what a typical week looks like, what demands constant attention vs. what needs deeper investigation
Explain the major story threads that run through everything and how they connect

2. "The Players You'll Get to Know"

Don't just list names - tell stories about who these people are, why reporters keep going back to them, what they're good for
Describe the power dynamics: who influences what, which institutions matter most and why
Include practical tips: "When X happens, call Y first because..." or "Z always has good quotes on..."

3. "How Stories Get Written Here"

Analyze the actual writing style in the data: What makes a strong Baltimore story?
Show patterns: "Notice how most education stories open with a student or parent, then zoom out to policy..."
Describe sourcing strategies: who gets quoted, in what order, why
Point out what works: "The best stories on this beat do X..." with specific examples

4. "Building Your Beat"

Walk through HOW to develop sources (not just who they are)
Explain what records requests to file, when, and why
Describe how to balance reactive coverage with enterprise
Give concrete advice: "Every Monday, check X..." or "When you hear Y, that's your cue to..."

5. "Stories Waiting to Be Told"

Present 3-5 story ideas as pitches, not bullet points
For each: "Here's the angle, here's why it matters, here's who to talk to first, here's the document that will unlock it"
Explain the reporting process: "Start by..., then..., watch out for..."

6. "What You Need to Know Walking In"

Share essential context as narrative: "Here's what's really going on with..."
Flag sensitivities: "When covering X, remember that..."
Provide the historical backdrop that makes current stories make sense

Write this as a 1-2 page guide that reads like a conversation, not a data dump. Use short paragraphs, direct address ("you'll find that..."), and specific examples from the data. Make it something a reporter would actually want to read and refer back to - practical, insightful, and voice-driven

Answer: 
I'll draft the narrative beat guide for a reporter new to Baltimore and beat reporting. I'll use a conversational, mentorship tone and draw insights from the data.

Understanding the Baltimore Beat: A Reporter's Guide

Listen up. Baltimore isn't just another city beat - it's a complex ecosystem of stories, resilience, and transformation. This isn't about chasing headlines; it's about understanding the pulse beneath the surface.

The Daily Rhythm
Your beat is part breaking news, part long-form storytelling. Some days you'll be tracking crime stats or city council maneuvers, other days you'll be diving deep into neighborhood narratives about recovery, hope, and systemic challenges.

A typical week might look like:
- Monday: City Hall check-in, tracking policy developments
- Tuesday: Community meetings in neighborhoods like Mondawmin or Bolton Hill
- Wednesday: Following up on crime prevention initiatives 
- Thursday: Investigating systemic issues like housing vacancy or economic disparities
- Friday: Enterprise reporting, building source relationships

Major Story Threads
1. Crime and Community Healing
2. Economic Resilience 
3. Neighborhood Transformation
4. Systemic Inequity
5. Local Leadership and Accountability
