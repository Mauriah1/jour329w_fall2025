# Baltimore Beat Guide: Understanding Maryland's Largest City

Welcome to Baltimore. If you're coming from another region, you're about to cover a city that defies easy categorization—a place of deep historical wounds and remarkable resilience, where community-led solutions often outpace government responses, and where the same neighborhood can tell stories of both devastating decline and stubborn hope.

## Getting Your Bearings

Baltimore isn't just Maryland's largest city—it's a city-state unto itself, separate from Baltimore County, with its own unique governance structure and challenges. With roughly 600,000 residents, it's a majority-Black city (about 62%) that has been shaped profoundly by redlining, white flight, deindustrialization, and more recently, by efforts to reverse decades of disinvestment.

The city is defined by its neighborhoods—about 278 of them, depending on how you count. From wealthy enclaves like Roland Park and Bolton Hill to struggling communities like Sandtown-Winchester and Mondawmin, the disparities are stark and visible. The Baltimore Neighborhood Indicators Alliance (BNIA) is an essential resource for understanding these divides through data.

## Key People to Know

**Brandon Scott** became mayor in 2020 after serving as City Council president. He's Baltimore's youngest mayor in more than a century and took office during a pandemic, inheriting challenges including persistent violence, vacant properties, and ongoing investigations into his predecessor. Scott has emphasized violence prevention programs and reducing crime has been central to his administration. His approval ratings have improved as the city has seen historic reductions in homicides.

**Wes Moore**, Maryland's governor since 2023, is the state's first Black governor and maintains a close relationship with Baltimore. He's been involved in city issues from the Key Bridge collapse response to supporting violence prevention funding.

The late **Rep. Elijah Cummings** (who died in 2019) remains an important figure in understanding Baltimore's recent history. His legacy includes the Elijah Cummings Healing City Act, which requires trauma-informed training for city employees—a significant policy response to the city's pervasive violence and poverty.

## The Key Bridge Collapse: A Defining Moment

On March 26, 2024, the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapsed after a container ship struck a support column, killing six construction workers and closing the Port of Baltimore. This wasn't just an infrastructure disaster—it was an economic and psychological blow to a city already struggling with its self-image.

**What you need to understand:**

The federal government moved quickly, with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers clearing the channel in 77 days—faster than initially projected. The port reopened partially by late April 2024 and fully by May. Despite fears of economic catastrophe, Baltimore largely avoided the worst outcomes thanks to swift federal response, emergency state assistance (the PORT Act provided $34 million in grants and loans), and community resilience.

**Story angles to explore:**
- How have businesses adapted long-term to traffic pattern changes? The bridge carried 35,000 daily commuters who now use tunnels or longer routes
- What's happening with the $2 billion bridge reconstruction, scheduled for completion by Fall 2028? The new design features a 45-foot taller deck
- Are there ongoing impacts to workers who lost income? The reimbursement programs and their effectiveness?
- The memorial and remembrance efforts for the six workers killed

The bridge collapse also revealed something important about Baltimore: when crisis hits, informal networks and community organizations often respond faster than official channels.

## Violence and Public Safety: The Defining Challenge

Baltimore's crime problem is both overstated and undeniable. The city has struggled with high homicide rates for decades—more than 300 murders annually for seven straight years through 2021. But context matters.

**Recent developments:**

In 2024, Baltimore saw historic progress. Four Safe Streets zones (Belvedere, Park Heights, Woodburne-McCabe, Franklin Square) went a full year without homicides. April 2025 saw just five homicides citywide—the lowest monthly total in recorded history. This represents real progress, though the city still faces significant challenges.

**Safe Streets program:**

This is Baltimore's flagship violence intervention initiative, administered by the Lifebridge Health Center for Hope (six zones) and Catholic Charities (four zones). It uses a public health approach—treating violence as a disease that can be interrupted. The program covers about 3% of the city's footprint but has shown measurable impact.

**Critical threat:** In 2025, the Trump administration cut $1.2 million in federal funding to Center for Hope, threatening the program's existence despite its success. At least $8 million in federal grants were cut citywide. This is an ongoing story—what happens to violence prevention when federal support disappears?

**Sources to develop:**
- Freedom Jones, director of violence intervention programs, Center for Hope
- Emanuel Tarrant-Bey, Safe Streets site director in Belvedere
- Scott Cowan, president of Local 333, International Longshoremen's Association (good on economic impacts)

**Juvenile crime** remains a contentious issue. In November 2024, there were calls to remove Department of Juvenile Services Secretary Vincent Schiraldi, though overall crime was decreasing. The "squeegee workers" issue—young people cleaning windshields at intersections for money—became a flashpoint after a deadly 2022 confrontation, leading to a controversial city plan balancing enforcement with workforce development.

## Neighborhoods: The Real Baltimore

Baltimore is a city of neighborhoods, and you cannot understand it from downtown alone. Here are some areas that tell important stories:

**Sandtown-Winchester/Harlem Park** (West Baltimore): This is where Freddie Gray lived and died in 2015. High poverty (median income around $24,625 per capita in Mondawmin area), significant vacant housing (13.93% vacancy in Greater Mondawmin in 2020), but also deep community organizing. First Mount Calvary Baptist Church here feeds thousands through its food programs—six days a week during the pandemic.

**Mondawmin**: Once a thriving commercial center with a mall built by developer James Rouse in 1956, now struggling with the mall's violent reputation and business instability. However, there's significant investment happening: the $70 million Village at Mondawmin project is transforming the former Target space, and new breweries and restaurants are opening. The number of neighborhood businesses fluctuated from 22 per 1,000 residents in 2013 to 12 in 2019.

**Old Town** (downtown): Per capita income was just $12,100 in 2020, below the poverty line, contrasting sharply with nearby Little Italy's $65,834. The Old Town Mall, once a thriving 64-store shopping district, is largely dormant. About 86% of residents rent. This is one of the poorest areas in a poor city.

**East Baltimore** (Midway, Belair-Edison): These adjacent neighborhoods show stark contrasts. Midway has high poverty and about 20% of properties vacant. Belair-Edison is doing better—per capita income rose $2,000-$18,000 from 2010-2020 while parts of Midway actually lost income. Faith-based organizations like Shrine of the Little Flower church bridge gaps in services.

**Carrollton Ridge** (Southwest): Only 25% homeownership, nearly 28% of properties vacant, 16% unemployment. It originated as a German immigrant community in the 1870s but now struggles with trash dumping and deteriorating housing stock.

## Housing and Vacant Properties

Baltimore has approximately 13,000 vacant and abandoned homes and more than 20,000 vacant lots. This isn't just an eyesore—it's a public health crisis, economic anchor, and symbol of disinvestment.

**Recent initiatives:**

In October 2024, Governor Moore launched the "Reinvest Baltimore" program via executive order, aiming to transform at least 5,000 vacant properties into thriving homes or businesses over five years. Jake Day, secretary of Maryland Housing & Community Development, chairs the coordinating council.

**The challenge:** Many longtime residents are trapped in deteriorating homes. The tax sale system threatens low-income homeowners who fall behind on bills, often targeting African American communities, elderly adults, and people with disabilities. Property tax credits exist but aren't automatically renewed, and the application process is a barrier.

**Story angles to explore:**
- Progress on the Reinvest Baltimore initiative—are 5,000 properties a realistic goal?
- How are neighborhood groups like Fight Blight Bmore (founded by Nneka N'namdi) working on vacancy?
- The impact of Project C.O.R.E. (Creating Opportunities for Renewal and Enterprise), which demolishes abandoned houses
- Tax sale reform efforts and their effectiveness

## Economic Realities

The wealth gap in Baltimore is profound and racialized. In 2020, citywide per capita income was $32,699, but that masks enormous variation—from $12,100 in Old Town to $65,834 in Little Italy.

**Key economic drivers:**

**The Port of Baltimore** handled 52.3 million tons of foreign cargo in 2023, ranking first nationally for autos and light trucks (847,000 vehicles). It generates about 15,300 direct jobs and supports nearly 140,000 jobs linked to port activities. The Key Bridge collapse threatened this, but recovery has been faster than feared.

**Johns Hopkins** (the university and hospital system) is the largest private employer in Maryland and anchors much of Baltimore's economy. Hopkins' relationship with surrounding neighborhoods is complex—it's both an economic engine and has been criticized for aggressive expansion and community displacement.

**Small businesses** struggle but persist. The "Smalltimore" project in 2024 found tight-knit networks among small business owners who support each other despite bureaucratic challenges. Many are in historically redlined areas and serve as community anchors beyond their commercial function.

**Food insecurity** is significant. During the pandemic, the Maryland Food Bank saw distribution rates increase 96% between March and October 2020. Many churches and community organizations run food programs—First Mount Calvary Baptist Church went from monthly produce boxes to six-day-a-week food distribution.

## Child Care Crisis

Baltimore City lost 15.64% of child care providers between 2020 and 2024 (from 793 to 669), and child care slots dropped 11.19%. This is the eighth smallest decrease statewide, but still significant. The number of top-rated (5-star EXCELS) facilities fell from 29 to 25.

In Baltimore County, the provider drop was 18.16% and slots decreased 5.95%. But top-rated facilities increased from 35 to 39.

**The challenge:** Many providers are women running home-based operations, often serving single mothers. They cite issues with affordability, staff retention, managing parental expectations, and regulations that make infant care particularly difficult. This affects workforce participation and perpetuates poverty cycles.

## Education

Baltimore City Public Schools face significant challenges. At Frederick Douglass High School, where a school shooting occurred in February 2019, students later testified to the City Council about trauma and its impact on learning. Their advocacy helped pass the Elijah Cummings Healing City Act.

**High school completion rates** vary by neighborhood—75% in some areas versus 82% in Belair-Edison and 78% citywide. These numbers reflect broader neighborhood conditions.

**Henderson-Hopkins School** in East Baltimore became a model during the pandemic, transforming from a student meal site to a community food distribution center serving 250-300 families weekly, though only 30 were school families. This illustrates how schools function as community anchors beyond education.

## Trauma and Public Health

Baltimore is a city scarred by trauma—from violence to poverty to historical racism. The Elijah Cummings Healing City Act (signed February 2020) requires all city workers be trained in trauma-informed responses. This paradigm shift recognizes that trauma changes how people view the world and interact with institutions.

**Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs)** are prevalent—growing up with incarcerated parents, substance abuse, violence, unstable housing. Three Frederick Douglass High students who spoke at City Council (Jaionna Santos, Bryonna Harris, Damani Thomas) exemplified this: they'd normalized violence until a school shooting forced them to confront it.

**Community responses:**

- **Barbershops as health centers**: New Beginnings barbershop (owned by Troy Staton) partners with Kaiser Permanente to provide blood pressure checks, HIV testing, flu shots, and mental health support. Six other shops participate. This leverages the trust relationship between barbers and clients.

- **Faith-based support**: Churches like New Psalmist Baptist Church (where Rep. Cummings worshipped for nearly 40 years) provide both spiritual and practical support. Pastor Bishop Walter Thomas and community leaders emphasize that healing requires addressing systemic issues, not just individual trauma.

- **Youth mentoring**: Wesley Hawkins founded The Nolita Project (named for his mother who died from addiction) to mentor Baltimore teenagers. He meets weekly with students, works where they are, and addresses trauma directly.

## Political Landscape and Corruption

Baltimore is overwhelmingly Democratic—about 85% voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016. The last Republican mayor was Theodore McKeldin in 1963, and the last Republican City Council member resigned in 1942. Governor Larry Hogan was popular statewide but didn't carry Baltimore.

**Catherine Pugh scandal:** The former mayor (Democrat, served 2016-2019) resigned in disgrace in 2019 after revelations about her "Healthy Holly" children's book scheme. She fraudulently sold books to organizations with political connections, including the University of Maryland Medical System where she sat on the board. She pleaded guilty in November 2019 to conspiracy, wire fraud, and tax evasion, receiving a three-year federal prison sentence in February 2020. She made nearly $800,000 from the scheme and underreported her income by more than $290,000 in 2016.

The scandal exemplifies corruption concerns that have plagued Baltimore. Brandon Scott ran for mayor in 2020 partly on ethics reform, and the City Council passed ethics and transparency bills that year.

## Freddie Gray and the 2015 Uprising

You must understand this context. Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old Black man, died April 19, 2015, from injuries suffered in police custody. Protests turned violent April 27, 2015, with the worst damage in West Baltimore neighborhoods including Mondawmin (where it started), Sandtown-Winchester, and Penn North.

**Lasting impacts:**

- Dwayne Weaver's Keystone Pharmacy in West Baltimore was left 95% empty after being looted. He's back in business but questions persist about safety.
- The uprising exposed deep wounds—poverty, policing issues, vacant housing, lack of opportunity—that predated Gray's death
- It changed how the city talks about police accountability and community relations
- Rep. Cummings' calm leadership during the crisis (he walked the streets urging peace) enhanced his stature

Many Baltimore residents lost confidence in police after Gray's death. The city saw more than 300 homicides annually for seven straight years afterward, though crime has recently decreased significantly.

## Institutions to Understand

**Baltimore Neighborhood Indicators Alliance (BNIA)**: Essential data source tracking neighborhood conditions across 55 indicators. Run through the University of Baltimore, it provides granular data on everything from vacancy rates to income to crime.

**Lifebridge Health Center for Hope**: Administers six of ten Safe Streets zones. It's the largest street intervention program run by any hospital in the country.

**Maryland Food Bank**: Saw distribution increase 96% during the pandemic. Works with churches, schools, and community organizations.

**Innovation Works Baltimore**: Supports social entrepreneurs in economically disadvantaged neighborhoods. It's part of a broader ecosystem of community development organizations.

**Johns Hopkins University and Hospital System**: Cannot be overstated as an economic and institutional force. Also runs studies on everything from sewage backups to Key Bridge impacts.

**University of Maryland Medical System**: The health system that was at the center of the Healthy Holly scandal. Major regional healthcare provider with complex political connections.

## Story Ideas and Undercovered Angles

### Violence Prevention Without Federal Funding
The Trump administration cut $1.2 million to Center for Hope in 2025, threatening Safe Streets just as it was showing historic success. How are they maintaining services? What's being cut? Can city/state funding replace federal dollars? Are the historic crime reductions sustainable?

### The Squeegee Collaborative Outcomes
Mayor Scott created this in July 2022 after the Timothy Reynolds murder. The plan includes anti-panhandling enforcement in six zones starting 2023 and financial support for workers entering training programs. **Caveat**: This may have evolved significantly—check current status. Is it working? Are young people taking advantage of training programs? Has enforcement started and what's the impact?

### Reinvest Baltimore Progress
Governor Moore's October 2024 executive order aims to transform 5,000 vacant properties in five years. Where are they starting? What's the strategy? Who's benefiting—longtime residents or new investors? Is this gentrification dressed up as revitalization?

### Key Bridge Reconstruction Politics
The $2 billion rebuild (federally funded) is scheduled for Fall 2028. Are there cost overruns? Community input on design? Workforce development opportunities? The Lee family's appeal of Adnan Syed's release is pending (separate story, but illustrates legal complexity). Separately, how are Baltimore County commuters adjusting long-term?

### Child Care Provider Crisis
Baltimore lost 124 child care providers since 2020. Who are these providers? Why did they close? What happens to families when neighborhood providers disappear? Are there innovative solutions emerging?

### Tax Sale Reform
Legislation like HB252 (sponsored by Del. Robert Long) would defer owner-occupied properties from tax sales. **Caveat**: Check if this passed and what the implementation looks like. Are vulnerable homeowners still losing houses? Is there a better system emerging?

### Small Business Networks
The "Smalltimore" project revealed tight-knit business communities despite challenges. Profile specific business clusters—how are they supporting each other? What role does race play? Which neighborhoods have thriving small business communities despite poverty?

### Faith-Based Service Provision
Churches provide enormous social services—food, counseling, youth programs, health screenings. Map this network. How much is the religious community subsidizing failed government services? What happens when churches close or lose capacity?

### Trauma-Informed City Services
The Healing City Act requires trauma training for all city workers. How's implementation going? Are rec center coaches and sanitation workers actually getting trained? Can you measure impact—are city services more responsive to trauma?

### Port of Baltimore Long-Term
The port recovered quickly after the bridge collapse, but are there lasting impacts? Did any shipping companies permanently shift to other ports? How's the relationship with maritime unions? What about Preakness Stakes—there were threats to move it from Pimlico to Laurel Park. **Check current status** of this debate.

### Gentrification and Displacement
Areas like Mondawmin are seeing new investment—breweries, restaurants, mixed-use development. Who's benefiting? Are longtime residents being displaced? Document the tension between "revitalization" that preserves communities versus development that replaces them.

### Hopkins' Community Impact
Johns Hopkins is a massive presence. Profile specific neighborhoods adjacent to Hopkins expansion. How do residents view the university? Are there successful community benefit agreements? Or is this institutional expansion displacing vulnerable communities?

### Food Insecurity Infrastructure
During the pandemic, Henderson-Hopkins School, First Mount Calvary Baptist, and others created food distribution networks. Are these permanent? What happens as emergency funding expires? The city distributed 9 million pounds of food boxes and 5.7 million meals between April-October 2020 using CARES Act funding. What's the current state?

### Adnan Syed Update
He was released in September 2022 after DNA excluded him, but the Lee family's appeal is pending. **Caveat**: This case could have resolved. If ongoing, his neighbor Betty Gaskins (who always believed in his innocence) and his actual reintegration into the community would be compelling.

### Criminal Justice Reform Implementation
Beyond Syed, Baltimore has been a testing ground for progressive prosecutors. What's the current state of reforms? What's working and what's not? How are police and community groups responding?

### Barbershop Health Model Expansion
Kaiser Permanente partnered with seven barbershops for health services. Has this expanded? What are health outcomes? Could this model work for other services? Are insurance companies embracing it?

### Housing Court and Evictions
The tax sale system affects homeowners, but what about renters? Baltimore has an eviction crisis that predates and was worsened by the pandemic. What protections exist? How are tenant advocates responding?

### Squeegee Workers as Entrepreneurs
Rather than just framing them as a "problem," some are young entrepreneurs. Are there success stories of squeegee workers who transitioned to other work? What about the ones who stay—how do they see themselves?

### Old Town Revitalization—or Not
This downtown neighborhood has per capita income of $12,100, below poverty line. There have been redevelopment plans for years. **Check current status**. If there's development happening, who benefits? If not, why has nothing changed despite proximity to downtown and Little Italy?

### Baltimore's Water Crisis
In September 2022, there was an E. coli outbreak in Sandtown-Winchester and Harlem Park. In 2021, CNS documented widespread sewage backup problems and an inadequate reimbursement program. What's the current state of water infrastructure? Are sewage backups continuing? Has the reimbursement program improved?

### Climate and Infrastructure
Baltimore's sewer system is over a century old and overwhelmed by wet weather events. Climate change means more intense storms. What's the plan? How are vulnerable communities affected?

### Opioid Crisis
References in the stories to substance abuse and trauma suggest ongoing opioid issues. What's the current state? How are communities responding beyond traditional medical models?

### Community Land Trusts
Are there efforts to use community land trusts or other models to preserve affordable housing while neighborhoods improve? Could this prevent displacement in gentrifying areas?

## Finding Sources

The stories reveal several source categories:

**Community organizers and nonprofit leaders:**
- Nneka N'namdi (Fight Blight Bmore)
- Lamontre Randall (Innovation Works)
- Rev. Derrick DeWitt Sr. (First Mount Calvary Baptist Church)
- Troy Staton (New Beginnings barbershop)
- Wesley Hawkins (The Nolita Project)
- Janet Arce (Fundación Janet Arce)

**Academic experts:**
- Seema Iyer (formerly Baltimore Neighborhood Indicators Alliance, now with UNHCR)
- Various Johns Hopkins researchers and professors
- Morgan State University faculty

**Business owners:**
They're often more candid than officials about neighborhood conditions and changes

**Residents:**
The stories are rich with residents who speak openly about challenges—don't just talk to officials

**City Council members:**
More accessible than you might think and often have detailed neighborhood knowledge. Zeke Cohen (who sponsored the Healing City Act) is particularly engaged in these issues.

## Caveats and Updates Needed

Several stories reference ongoing situations that may have resolved:

1. **Mayor Pugh's scandal (2019)**: She served her sentence—is she out of prison? Where is she now?

2. **Adnan Syed's case**: The Lee family's appeal was noted as pending in 2022. **This needs checking.**

3. **Squeegee Collaborative**: Enforcement was supposed to start in 2023. **What's the current status?**

4. **Preakness move threat**: The race was scheduled at Pimlico through 2020 (the 150th anniversary). **Where did this end up?**

5. **Project C.O.R.E.** and Reinvest Baltimore: Multiple demolition and revitalization initiatives. **What's the current state?**

6. **COVID emergency programs**: Many food programs and child care supports were pandemic responses. **Which are permanent?**

7. **Federal funding cuts**: The Trump administration cuts in 2025 (mentioned in the Safe Streets story) would be immediate and urgent if recent. **Confirm timing and current impacts.**

8. **Key Bridge reconstruction**: Scheduled for Fall 2028 completion but check for any changes to timeline or funding.

9. **Tax sale legislation (HB252)**: This was pending in 2021. **Did it pass? What's the implementation?**

10. **Juvenile justice leadership**: Calls to remove Vincent Schiraldi in November 2024. **What happened?**

## Tone and Approach

Baltimore residents are used to national media parachuting in for violence stories then leaving. They're skeptical but often willing to talk if you show genuine interest in understanding complexity, not just extracting quotes.

The city has legitimate problems—don't minimize them. But it also has extraordinary community strength, creativity, and resilience—don't miss that either. The best Baltimore stories hold both truths simultaneously.

People here have deep knowledge of their neighborhoods' histories. Ask about redlining, about what used to be here, about how things have changed. Many neighborhoods that look hopeless to outsiders are home to people who've lived there for decades and have no intention of leaving.

Finally: "Smalltimore" is real. People know each other across unexpected boundaries. Your source at one organization will likely know someone at another. Use these networks, but be careful about confidences—word travels fast in a small big city.

Baltimore is exhausting to cover and deeply rewarding. Welcome to the beat.
