For my first revised prompt, I initially aimed to create a beat book for reporters new to both Baltimore and beat reporting, but after receiving my answers, I knew it needed to change. This style of prompt provided very generic answers, a multitude of bullet points and conceptual overviews like "Safe Streets is important", all things I wasn't going for.

My second revised prompt used the prompt.txt that was provided, but I added that it should be a beat guide for a seasoned journalist who is new to Maryland, while also including practical application. This provided a very sophisticated read, it had very comforting langauge. For example it opened with "Welcome to Baltimore", simple but effective. I also likeed that it catered to the fact that if you're coming from another region, you're about to cover a city that has easy categorization. For me, I was mostly pleased with how narrative it was, and it included everything I was going for as far as people, institutions, neighborhoods, etc. The guide also presented story ideas as investigation questions rather than simple pitches something else I liked. I also was pleased with the practical advice at the end, however some of the tone when it generated practical advice was a little blunt to me and something I would change. I would also add more practical reporting advice because it did lack that, but overall I was happy with the results that yielded from this prompt.

My third revised prompt also used the prompt.txt that was provided. I tweaked this prompt to create a beat book for a person who is generally a sports reporter but is coming to Maryland and has to cover Baltimore. The results from this prompt were quite interesting. It wasn't as nearly narrative as my previous one. It opened with "Look, I get it, you've covered the Ravens, maybe the Orioles, but now you're diving into the actual city." It also was an entire guide used of sports analogies: Safe Streets zones became "franchises," vacant properties were compared to "broken stadium seats," and going a year without homicides was described as a "championship season." However it was the only version that included links, it included citations to original CNS Maryland stories. It also provided the most comprehensive detail, which I thought was very interesting. The guide included a timeline and a "Don't Be That Reporter" section with blunt advice, something I would definetly not add. It was more conversational and fun than informative, talking to the sports reporter as if they needed a crash course in city coverage rather than just beat mechanics.

However, there were things that all three versions had in common. All three guides featured Mayor Brandon Scott, Governor Wes Moore, and the late Rep. Elijah Cummings. They all discussed the Elijah Cummings Healing City Act, which requires trauma training for city employees. Every version covered the same major issues: violence and crime, the Safe Streets violence intervention program, the Key Bridge collapse on March 26, 2024, and the housing crisis with 13,000 vacant homes. They all highlighted the economic gaps between neighborhoods like Mondawmin versus Bolton Hill and Old Town versus Little Italy.

Something else that was quite common was that the guides covered the same neighborhoods: Sandtown-Winchester (Freddie Gray's area), Mondawmin, Old Town, Bolton Hill, and Little Italy, and mentioned Baltimore's 278+ distinct communities. They featured the same sources: Nneka N'namdi, Wesley Hawkins (The Nolita Project), Rev. Derrick DeWitt (First Mount Calvary Baptist), and Freedom Jones (Center for Hope). Historical references were identical: the 2015 Freddie Gray unrest, Catherine Pugh's "Healthy Holly" scandal, redlining's impact, and Trump's 2019 "rat-infested" comments about Baltimore.

Overall, I think my 2revised.md document was my best version of the beat book.
