The program, administered by Lifebridge Health Center for Hope, uses a public health approach to engage communities and prevent violence.", "content": "Crime fell across Baltimore City in 2024, which the Mayor\u2019s office said is thanks in part to programs like Safe Streets, the city\u2019s primary violence reduction program, which is administered by Lifebridge Health Center for Hope. Now, despite a year of landmark achievements, the center is in peril.\nCenter for Hope and other community-based crime prevention programs are facing an existential threat in the form of budget cuts \u2014 amounting to $1.2 million \u2014- from the Trump administration. Without those funds, last year\u2019s progress on citywide crime reduction may be erased, according to Freedom Jones, director of violence intervention programs for Center for Hope.\n\u201cWe have an ecosystem that has been working,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIf you strip the ecosystem, what is the likelihood of gun violence increasing? It is much greater.\u201d\nWhat is Safe Streets?\nSafe Streets has been the city\u2019s flagship gun violence reduction program for nearly two decades, starting in East Baltimore\u2019s McElderry Park in 2007. The program, originally founded in Chicago by epidemiologist Dr. Gary Slutkin, focuses its efforts on 10 zones around Baltimore, representing about 3% of the city\u2019s total footprint, according to Emanuel Tarrant-Bey, the Safe Streets site director in Belvedere.\nFour of the zones are administered by Catholic Charities of Baltimore while the other six fall under the Lifebridge Health Center for Hope, the largest street intervention program of any hospital in the country, according to Jones.\nSafe Streets is a community-based, public health-focused approach at violence prevention. The program aims to engage neighborhoods and denormalize violence, which Jones says has become a common occurrence for many Baltimoreans.\nCenter for Hope works with two Lifebridge Health hospitals, Sinai Hospital of Baltimore and Grace Medical Center \u2013 Baltimore, with the goal of breaking cycles of violence within the city, as the 72 hours after an violent incident are the highest risk period for acts of retaliation and further violence in a community, Jones said\nIn Belvedere, Tarrant-Bey runs monthly community meetings to engage and organize the neighborhood against gun violence. Although Safe Streets has been effective in this area, Tarrant-Bey said that more resources are needed to bring Belvedere\u2019s success to neighboring communities.\n\u201cWe can see that there\u2019s a great effect with our presence, but that also is an indication that we need more community involvement,\u201d Tarrant-Bey said. \u201cWe need more community partners. You need more community to bind to the idea.\u201d\nA landmark year\nIn 2024, Belvedere, along with three of other Center for Hope zones \u2014 Park Heights, Woodburne-McCabe and Franklin Square \u2014- marked a full year without homicides, reflecting the city\u2019s overall progress in violent crime reduction. That trend has continued into 2025, with the Baltimore Police Department reporting just five homicides citywide in April \u2014 the lowest number of monthly homicides in Baltimore\u2019s recorded history.\n\nBPD tracks all crime in the city, both violent and non-violent, by location type, such as street, residential, park or convenience store.\nStreet and residential locations see the vast majority of violent crime in Baltimore, about 82% of it in 2024. Violent street crime saw a steeper drop than violent residential crime last year, dropping 14%. Still, Tarrant-Bey said that it\u2019s the streets that need the most attention, due to social conditions they attract, like poverty or unemployment.\n\u201cWhen you have these areas filled with a bunch of individuals without a particular purpose or a particular interest in life at that particular moment, then that\u2019s where that disease of violence begins to spread,\u201d Tarrant-Bey said.\n\nNon-violent crime, which made up nearly 90% of all crime in Baltimore last year, was also down in 2024. Non-violent street crime fell almost 30% from 2023, the sharpest year-over-year drop of any location category. Overall, non-violent crime rates decreased in 20 out of the 36 location types tracked by BPD.\nOnly one location type, convenience stores, saw large spikes in both violent and non-violent crime last year. Tarrant-Bey said he believes convenience stores can act as a harboring point for violence, especially among youth. He hopes to engage with both store owners and local youth through community organizing and monthly meetings, although Safe Streets\u2019 future in Baltimore has become unclear.\nAn uncertain future\nThe Department of Justice, under the direction of the Trump administration, eliminated hundreds of millions of dollars in grants meant for over 350 organizations that focus on opioid addiction recovery and gun violence prevention over the past three weeks, including that $1.2 million bookmarked for Center for Hope.\nCenter for Hope isn\u2019t alone; other Baltimore advocacy organizations, including the Living Classrooms Foundation, Black Mental Health Alliance, Greater Baybrook Alliance and Roca, also lost grants during the Trump administration\u2019s sweeping funding cuts, according to a Safe Streets spokesperson. At least $8 million in federal grants have been cut citywide.\nFor Jones, the losses are already mounting. With about 10% of its budget abruptly cancelled, Center for Hope has been forced to cut its public health efficacy study at Johns Hopkins, as well as some trauma support programs throughout the city. While staffing remains unaffected for now, additional service at Safe Street, which was to be funded by the federal funds, has already been interrupted.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want violence to go up,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWe need the resources and the support to keep going in the right direction.\u201d"},

The Key Bridge was destroyed when a container ship rammed a support column, severing Interstate 695 crossing over the Patapsco River, a route used by some 35,000 daily commuters.\u00a0\nAbout one-quarter of those surveyed said the bridge loss affected their ability to get to work, to school or to see family or friends. Mac McComas, a coauthor of the report, said he was surprised the impacts didn\u2019t vary by race or demographics, which would typically be the case in Baltimore.\n\u201cThis is maybe the one thing that could happen in Baltimore that would impact kind of everybody fairly equally,\u201d McComas said Monday in an interview with Capital News Service.\u00a0\nThe survey found that 6 in 10 residents who lived within three miles of the bridge reported the collapse affected their daily lives.\nLooking ahead to the Key Bridge rebuilding, the survey found about 73% of respondents think it will take longer than four years to rebuild the bridge. \u201cThere\u2019s this kind of distrust in local government, federal government, state government to deliver on big infrastructure projects,\u201d McComas said."},

Reginald McMillan, who lost his job after the bridge collapsed, eventually found new employment and credited Maryland's resilient culture for helping him adjust.", "content": "It didn\u2019t take long after the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapsed into the Patapsco River for Reginald McMillan, 57, to lose his job. With the Port of Baltimore suddenly closed, McMillan\u2019s trucking company cut workers. He received some severance pay, but suddenly his future \u2013 and the future of many others who rely on the port \u2014 was up in the air.\nMaryland leaders feared an economic catastrophe after the Dali struck the bridge on March 26, 2024, which closed the 700-foot-wide shipping channel. One year later, however, those fears largely never became reality.\u00a0\nExperts and community leaders identified three key factors in this mostly successful recovery: the federal government\u2019s incredibly fast clearing of the channel, emergency assistance from the state of Maryland, and a resilient community and culture.\nMcMillan rebounded, supplementing his income with a side gig at Patapsco Flea Market and eventually getting a new trucking job. \n\u201cIt was a shock, but people just adjust,\u201d McMillan said \u201cMaryland is very resilient\u2026it could have been much, much worse.\u201d\nAfter the Key Bridge collapse, Reginald McMillan said income from his shop at the Patapsco Flea Market helped him pay the bills. Photo by Zephan Matteson\nClearing the Channel\nThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers\u2019 response was imperative \u2014\u00a0and they knew it. Dorie Murphy, the corps\u2019 emergency management branch chief in Baltimore, said that each day the port was closed, there was an economic impact of $15 million.\u00a0\n\u201cThe Baltimore Harbor is a huge economic engine for all of Maryland and all of the East Coast of the United States,\u201d Jeff Peacock, the corp\u2019s debris removal chief, said. \u201cWe understood that every hour that it was down, we were losing economic position here in Baltimore.\u201d\nInitially, Peacock thought it was \u201cpretty optimistic\u201d that they would reopen the channel in three months. But it only took 77 days for the corps, along with the private salvage firms, the U.S. Coast Guard, Maryland Transportation Authority and the Department of Environment, to clear the channel to its 50-foot depth, allowing large container ships back into the port.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nFinancial Aid for Workers\nWhile the corps led a major salvage effort, Maryland lawmakers passed the PORT Act in early April, which dispersed some $34 million in grants and loans to businesses and workers \u2014 an effort spearheaded by Gov. Wes Moore and supported by Republicans such as state Sen. Johnny Ray Salling.\n The U.S. Small Business Administration provided $124 million in disaster relief loans to businesses.\n\nScott Cowan, president of the Local 333 chapter of the International Longshoremen\u2019s Association, and several other businesses in Baltimore said these programs allowed them to pay their bills and keep people working.\u00a0\nThe Worker Retention Program created funding for businesses working directly with the Port of Baltimore, providing funding up to a total of $200,000 per business. Almost 300 businesses received grant money totaling $17.7 million, according to Maryland Department of Labor data.\u00a0\nThe state\u2019s Department of Commerce had a Port of Baltimore Emergency Business Assistance Program that provided nearly $10 million in grants to affected businesses. The state Department of Housing and Community Development provided $5.9 million in assistance through its Neighborhood Business Works Program.\nIn addition, the PORT Act includes a permanent Fallen Transportation Workers Scholarship Program and Fund in honor of the six construction workers killed in the collapse. \nScott Cowan, president of the Local 333 chapter of the International Longshoremen\u2019s Association, said the state of Maryland\u2019s rapid response and grant funding helped workers survive. Photo by Rob Wells\nOnce the channel was clear, Cowan said it took several months to truly return to normal capacity. In the 24 months before the collapse, the port averaged about 718,000 tons of container flow per month. Those numbers took after the collapse, but recovered by November.\nLarger businesses were more insulated from the closure. Peter O\u2019Malley, vice president of corporate relations with American Sugar Refining, Inc. which owns Domino Sugar, said they were lucky since a ship had just arrived with a full load of raw sugar prior to the Key Bridge collapse.\u00a0\nWhile the channel was cut off, O\u2019Malley said the company was able to quickly re-route shipments to Philadelphia and truck them back down to Baltimore.\u00a0\n\u201cThough it cost more money, we kept our people working,\u201d O\u2019Malley said.\u00a0\nBut small businesses like independent trucking companies relied on Maryland state government grants.\u00a0\nBrendon Williams, the owner of Yellow Diamond Trucking based in Aberdeen, received a small grant.. Yellow Diamond Trucking is a two-person operation. Brendon Williams is the driver, and his wife Tanya is his dispatcher. \n\u201cI\u2019m a one-man band show, one truck. So, I mean, it was a lot harder for me,\u201d Williams said. \u201cEverybody has bills. I have a mortgage payment, car payment, you know, insurance, kids, grandkids\u2026 applying for benefits from the disaster helped us out.\u201d\u00a0\nTanya Williams said the process of getting the grant was very easy.\n\u201cI had no issues,\u201d Tanya Williams said. \u201cI gave them what they needed and it was really, really easy.\u201d \n\u00a0\n\nIn December, the port recorded its best month for the whole year \u2014 including before the bridge went down.\u00a0\nThere were also other relief options made available to small businesses in the wake of the collapse. Robert Lovett, the owner and operator of the trucking company Lovett and Sons, received a $25,000 Small Business Administration Economic Injury Disaster Loan.\n\u201cIt definitely helped us get through, and kind of tide things over,\u201d Lovett said.\nA resilient economy and community\nThe bridge collapse affected the daily lives of many Baltimore-area residents. The Baltimore Metropolitan Council showed commute times from Dundalk on the north side of the bridge to Ferndale in Anne Arundel County on the south side had doubled. Traffic remains the biggest complaint for many residents.\u00a0\u00a0\nBut on a macro scale, Baltimore recovered well.\nTake the trucker Reginald McMillan for example. He didn\u2019t take out a loan with the Small Business Administration, or receive any grant money. McMillan received severance pay from his company to help hold him over, but he said what really helped was income from New and Used R US, a general wares store at Patapsco Flea Market.\nHis regular customers supported him. \u201cIt\u2019s a community-based culture in here, and we just take care of each other in here,\u201d McMillan said.\nSusil Chhetri, manager of Joe\u2019s Tavern on Dundalk Avenue, said his reliable clientele has kept his business afloat in the aftermath of the Key Bridge collapse despite decreased foot traffic. \n\u201cThis kind of business, it hasn\u2019t been affected because people who gotta drink, gotta drink,\u201d Chhetri, 27, said.\u00a0\nErica Calvi, the owner of Bicoastal Trucking LLC in Columbia, received a $35,000 state worker retention grant. Calvi said this helped with paying drivers and maintenance, but business is still hard.\n\u201cWe\u2019re still recovering,\u201d Calvi said, \u201cWe have not recovered.\u201d\nCalvi said she wasn\u2019t aware that Small Business Administration loans were an option, and wished the programs were advertised better. \nKevin Perez, 24, owner of Don Chago\u2019s Taco Bar, a food truck on the other side of the parking lot from Joe\u2019s, said his customers\u2019 fear of deportations has been a bigger concern for his business than the bridge collapse.\n\u00a0\u201cA lot of our Hispanic community is scared to come outside: the fear that ICE is going to be standing in the corner and just pick them up right there,\u201d Perez said.\u00a0\nKevin Perez, owner of Don Chago\u2019s Taco Bar credits\u2019 his regular customers for keeping his business afloat following the Key Bridge collapse. Photo by Andrew Mollenauer\nPerez thanks these loyal patrons for keeping his business going. \u201cThey\u2019re loyal to us, so we always appreciate it.\u201d \nThe road ahead\u00a0\nLooking forward, business leaders around the port are optimistic.\nScott Cowan said that almost all of his longshoremen are back working and the port is going to begin hiring again.\n\u00a0\n\nIn February this year the new Key Bridge design was unveiled. The new bridge deck will be 45 feet taller, allowing larger boats to access the harbor. The federal government passed legislation to cover the estimated $2 billion to rebuild the bridge, scheduled by Fall 2028.\nAndrew Bauer, an economist and vice president for Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, said that the reconstruction could have a positive impact on business in Baltimore.\nBauer thinks losses caused by the immediate aftermath of the collapse can be made up for with the rebuilding \u2014 and that hard-hit communities close to the bridge could especially benefit.\nConstruction workers \u201care going to be passing through those neighborhoods to get to work on the bridge,\u201d Bauer said.\nA survey of Baltimore area residents conducted by The Tyson Group, a research firm, showed 76% of respondents learned more about the importance of the Port of Baltimore since the collapse.\u00a0\nTinglong Dai, a Johns Hopkins Carey Business School professor, said the port\u2019s central location along the East Coast and easy access to the Midwest makes it invaluable to the nation\u2019s ocean-based trade.\u00a0\n\u201cI know this sounds silly to say this, but I actually think that this disruption has really put the Port of Baltimore on the map,\u201d Dai said. \u201cPeople started calling us. People started realizing how valuable Baltimore is.\u201d\u00a0\n\u2013Sasha Allen, Emily Condon and Mikayla Roberts contributed."},

He remembers a time when he or his parents were familiar with almost every customer of his family business, located about a half-mile from Mondawmin Mall.\n\u201cKnowing every person that walks in and walks out, there\u2019s something to be said about that itself,\u201d Chang said. \u201cI think that\u2019s part of the reason we\u2019re still here.\u201d\nThe Mondawmin area and its mall has struggled with outbursts of violence and closures of high-profile businesses, such as Target in 2018. The neighborhood was where unrest in Baltimore began following the 2015 death of Freddie Gray from injuries sustained in police custody.\nAn influx of activity aimed at reviving this important part of West Baltimore, headlined by a developer launching a reconstruction of the empty Target space and a $20 million federal grant dedicated toward improving the Mondawmin transit hub, has given residents hope.\nMario Chang, owner of Gera Variety Discount Liquors. (Miles Grovic / Capital News Service)\nThe Mondawmin area of Baltimore is largely defined by its mall, founded in 1956 by famed developer and urban planner James Rouse. Mondawmin is a three-level mall featuring retailers such as Ross Dress for Less, Family Dollar, Foot Locker and Jimmy Jazz, and restaurants such as TGI Fridays, and Popeyes. Shoppers grocery store is also a major presence.\nViolence in and surrounding Mondawmin Mall has hurt its reputation for decades and the management now requires anyone age 17 and under to be accompanied by a parent or an adult age 21 and older after 6 p.m. on weekdays. On April 13, a 7-year-old girl was shot twice while shopping with her mother. \nAn area of the city once known for its large homes and revered for its design, Mondawmin is today known for being located in one of Baltimore\u2019s most disenfranchised areas. Among its challenges is a lack of stability for small businesses. From 2010 through 2020, the number of neighborhood businesses in the Greater Mondawmin Area fluctuated, peaking at 22 businesses per 1,000 residents in 2013 before reaching its low of 12 businesses in 2019, according to the Baltimore Neighborhood Indicators Alliance. \nEquipped with a Metro station right outside the mall, and Coppin State University and Baltimore City Community College campuses nearby, Greater Mondawmin has the components necessary to create a stable environment for local businesses, neighborhood activists said. \n\u201cEverything\u2019s been there. You talk to the actual neighbors that know the community, they know everything\u2019s there,\u201d said Chang, whose store is located 0.4 miles from the mall. \u201cIt\u2019s just more or less getting the right people involved, getting the right investments happening.\u201d\nOne significant project is a multimillion-dollar revitalization effort in the space once occupied by the Target, which was shut down after years of underperforming.\nDeveloper Tim Regan, CEO of Whiting-Turner Contracting Company, purchased the former Target site in 2022, and launched a new project called The Village at Mondawmin, with the intention of turning it into a community mainstay. As of March 9, there are four confirmed tenants of The Village at Mondawmin: CareFirst, an insurance provider; Edenbridge Pace, a health-care provider; TouchPoint Baltimore, a community collaboration center co-founded by Regan; and Whiting-Turner.\nWhiting-Turner is one of the state\u2019s largest developers, with a reported $10.8 billion in revenue in 2022, according to Baltimore Business Journal. \n[/vc_column_text][vc_raw_html css=\u201d\u201d]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[/vc_raw_html][/vc_column][/vc_row]\nIn June 2023, a group of Maryland\u2019s U.S. senators and congressmen announced a $20 million grant to support the improvement of Mondawmin Station, one of Baltimore\u2019s busiest transit hubs. The renovation of Mondawmin\u2019s Frederick Douglass High School, which is planned by the city\u2019s 21st Century School Building Program, has a budget of $118 million, according to the project\u2019s website.\n\u201cThis is all happening with city support amongst a time when the area is seeing a great deal of investment,\u201d said Eli Lopatin, executive director of the Greater Mondawmin Coordinating Council.\nAside from the multimillion dollar projects, some community groups are taking a ground-up approach. A half-mile from the mall, Rasheed Aziz runs the E.M.A.G.E. Center and Citywide Youth Development, where he teaches high schoolers and young adults entrepreneurial skills, launching brands in the center and creating job opportunities for young adults.\n\u201cWe want the E.M.A.G.E. Center to be the catalyst now that we have a solid foundation [in Mondawmin],\u201d said Aziz, whose business is amid a massive expansion.\u00a0 \nAziz has partnered with the West North Avenue Development Authority (WNADA), a group attempting to revitalize a historic part of Baltimore. Teresa Stephens, the organization\u2019s public affairs officer said, \u201cMondawmin is a diamond in the rough.\u201d\u00a0\nRasheed Aziz, owner of the E.M.A.G.E. Center, scoops sorbet at his storefront. (Shaun Chornobroff / Capital News Service)\nThe West North Avenue Development Authority is seeking to have 31% of businesses owned by minorities.\u00a0\nAside from building up businesses, the Mondawmin neighborhood faces a challenge in reducing local housing vacancies. Lopatin said he\u2019s already noticing people emigrating from other major cities into the Mondawmin area. From 2010 through 2020, the percentage of vacant houses in Greater Mondawmin rose from 10.29% to 13.93%, according to the Baltimore Neighborhood Indicators Alliance. Bordering areas such as Sandtown-Winchester/Harlem Park and Upton/Druid Heights had triple Mondawmin\u2019s 2010 vacancy rate.\u00a0\nChad Williams, the executive director of the West North Avenue Development Authority, said one strategy to combat residential vacancies would be to offer leases as a transition to ownership for potential residents. \nWilliams said the low price of real estate in Mondawmin is a clear benefit for potential businesses.\u00a0\u201cThe income level might not be the same as in certain parts of the city. However, the growth opportunity is there,\u201d Williams said. \u201cSo it\u2019s best to get in now.\u201d\nSome Baltimore business owners, such as videographer Julian Hamer, who lives in the Mondawmin area, are wondering who will stand to benefit from this influx of money.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m keeping my eyes on everything that everyone\u2019s doing, where money\u2019s going and flowing,\u201d said Hamer, co-founder of Fearless Video, which has produced work for Vice President Kamala Harris, among others. Hamer wants to know \u201cwho\u2019s having opportunities, who is being handed some of these opportunities and who\u2019s able to leverage these opportunities.\u201d"},

(Capital News Service / Miles Grovic)\n\u00a0\nInterviews with several neighborhood-based child care centers in Baltimore reveal operators who emphasize their role in caring for the entire community and supporting young parents.\u00a0\n\u201cI just be trying to help all of them that I run across and talk to them,\u201d said LaKesha Solomon, owner of Solomon\u2019s Family Daycare near Ellwood Park. \u201cThey always say \u2018we\u2019re coming to the daycare lady\u2019, so I know a lot of them,\u201d Solomon said. \u201cI love my area.\u201d\u00a0\nSolomon has been in the neighborhood for 25 years, but she credits the network in the neighborhood for supporting both parents and providers. For example, if someone is unable to afford daycare or access government-provided childcare vouchers, people will step up to cover the cost, according to Solomon.\n\u201cIf they see somebody without [vouchers], they say, \u2018Take \u2019em up there to Ms. Kesha; fill out her paperwork and we\u2019ll talk to her,\u2019\u201d Solomon said. These vouchers are provided by the Child Care Scholarship Program, which offers vouchers redeemable at participating child care centers to families who meet program requirements, like being below a minimum income threshold.\u00a0\nChildren play at the Little Steps Childcare in Southwest Baltimore. (Capital News Service / Miles Grovic)\n\u00a0\nAccording to Census data, there were 35,285 women-owned day care centers in the United States in 2021. In 2020, there were 793 registered child care providers in Baltimore City. In 2024, there are now only 669, a 15.6% loss since the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Maryland State Department of Education data. In Baltimore, there are a variety of child care centers run out of family homes by women, such as Latoya Turpin, who runs the newly established Little Steps Childcare out of her house in Southwest Baltimore. \nTurpin said she had worked in other day care centers, but now as an owner she sought to create something different. Turpin said the focus of other day care centers she worked at \u201cwasn\u2019t about the children, honestly. I feel like they cared more about the money than the quality of child care that the children were getting.\u201d\u00a0\nTurpin\u2019s child care prioritizes curriculum and development, while also keeping the parents in the loop through an app called Brightwheel. The app allows parents to learn what their child is doing at any time during the day via posts and updates from Turpin, such as the time of a nap or that they have eaten.\nTurpin\u2019s sense of community appealed to Jillian Kumar, a single mother raising a 1-year-old girl, Wynter. Kumar called Turpin, who immediately answered the phone, answered her questions and set up a time to look at the day care. Finding Little Steps Childcare was a gift, she said.\u00a0\n\u201cIt was all very easy, which as a new mom, single mom in over her head it was very nice that I didn\u2019t have to, you know, jump through a bunch of hoops,\u201d Kumar said.\nLatoya Turpin sits with a child at her home-based day care center in Southwest Baltimore. (Capital News Service / Miles Grovic)\n\u00a0\nKumar\u2019s struggles as a single mother in Baltimore are not uncommon. The Baltimore Neighborhood Indicators Alliance-Jacob France Institute shows 51% of female-headed households in Baltimore have children under the age of 18. Some of the challenges for Kumar and other new parents involve delays in accessing child care vouchers, which in turn delayed her ability to return to work. And this added stress on her family, who had to babysit her daughter.\u00a0\nThere are also complications from urban life in general. Kumar said her car was stolen twice after she had given birth and that her car seat and stroller were also stolen. Her neighbors, however, came to assist her.\u00a0\n\u201cThe community really came around for me in that time of need,\u201d Kumar said. \u201cI was able to get a car seat and stroller for free that was in amazing condition, and was actually the one that I had wanted when I first got pregnant but was unable to afford.\u201d\nNot all young parents have such support. Turner sees the stress single parents face, and some of these parents search for an outlet, which she said can be drugs. These parents are \u201ctrying to duck reality and, and cope. That\u2019s their coping mechanism,\u201d Turner said. Some parents turn to smoking so much marijuana \u201cthat their children come in smelling like marijuana,\u201d Turner said.\nOther parents said these neighborhood-run and owned day care centers help ease worries about the safety of their children.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people out here who don\u2019t really care for the kids. They just care about the money,\u201d said Kieshe Gasque, a client of Turpin\u2019s Little Steps Childcare. Gasque said other child care centers are \u201cnot taking care of them the proper way\u201d such as failing to change diapers. Having her children in the care of a quality person such as Turpin is an enormous relief, Gasque said.\n\u201cSo it\u2019s the simple fact of knowing that your child is in good hands,\u201d Gasque said. \u201cAnd you can go on with your workday or your life without thinking, \u2018Oh my god, is this person harming my child?\u2019\u201d\u00a0[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row]"},

According to the poll, 59% of voters are set on their candidate choice. The poll\u2019s margin of error ranges from 3.7% to 4.7%.\nDixon served as the city\u2019s mayor from 2007 to 2010 and is running to reclaim her seat.\nAs Scott gears up for his reelection campaign, his job approval rating among all surveyed voters has significantly improved, jumping from 37% in an October poll to 46%.\n\n\u201cBrandon Scott has improved his standing with the public since our last Goucher College Poll, \u2026His job approval and favorability ratings have both improved, as views toward the direction of the city,\u201d said Mileah Kromer, director of the Sarah T. Hughes Center for Politics at Goucher College, which conducts the poll.\nSixty-four percent of surveyed voters are optimistic about Baltimore\u2019s future. This optimism could be related to the crime reduction under Scott\u2019s administration.\n\nCrime remains a top concern among Baltimore City voters, with 88% identifying it as a significant issue in the upcoming mayoral election.\n\n\u201cWhile crime is still a key issue, the reduction in the murder rate has been an important accomplishment under the Scott administration,\u201d said Kromer.\nSince Scott took office in 2020, Baltimore has seen a 20% reduction in homicides, representing the city\u2019s most significant annual drop in history, according to his campaign website. Improper arrests were also cut in half, leading to the city\u2019s lowest homicide rate in nine years. In his reelection campaign, Scott emphasizes the crime reduction accomplishments under his administration.\nDixon emphasized the low crime levels under her administration at a news conference in January. She also outlined her crime and public safety plans, including the need to replenish the ranks of city law enforcement and pitch law enforcement as a good, stable career path for the younger generation to attract more talent to the profession, according to The Baltimore Banner.\nScott\u2019s approach differs, focusing on non-policing methods to reduce crime. In 2021, he orchestrated Baltimore City\u2019s $50 million donation to the Mayor\u2019s Office of Neighborhood Safety and Engagement (MONSE), funding a public health approach to violence prevention, according to a press release from the City of Baltimore.\nA majority of voters believe drug and substance abuse to be the leading cause of crime in Baltimore, with 83% voting it as a major factor in the issue. Baltimore\u2019s 2023 drug overdose rate was 1039, up from 2022\u2019s 939, according to data from Maryland\u2019s Office of Overdose Response.\nA candidate\u2019s plan or ability to improve public education is also a topic many likely Democratic voters are focusing on. 87% said it\u2019s a significant factor in deciding the candidate.\n\nOnly 12% of voters rated Baltimore City public schools with a grade of A-B, with 69% unsatisfied with the system, grading it a C-F on a grading scale. 77% of surveyed voters noted underfunded schools and a lack of educational opportunities for younger residents as significant issues facing the city."},

He worries how this may affect his furnishing business, but also how the port\u2019s closure may impact Baltimore\u2019s small business economy.\n\u201cMy bigger concern is for how the \u2018temporary\u2019 adjustments to logistics may stick and become permanent,\u201d Johnson, 39, said in an email. \u201cBecause of the timeframe for complete recovery, it is conceivable that many businesses that make arrangements to utilize NY, Philly, Norfolk, Wilmington and Richmond in the short term, may stick with it.\u201d\nMany other Baltimore businesses share his concerns. The March 26 collapse of the Key Bridge left six dead and left much of Baltimore\u2019s port blocked for imports and exports. Some 51,000 people rely on the port, either directly or indirectly, for their jobs. Because of this threat to the economy, Governor Wes Moore has approved $60 million in temporary assistance to workers and businesses.\nSome high-profile companies immediately shifted gears: first Royal Caribbean International moved its Vision of the Seas ship to sail from the port in Norfolk, Virginia. Then, CSX Corp., a major freight rail company, decided to add a new train route to bring supplies from Baltimore to New York. The U.S. Small Business Administration said more than 1,000 businesses in the Baltimore area have applied for emergency loans following the bridge collapse.\nFor trucking companies based in the city, the port closure resulted in major shifts in their operations and forced some drivers out of work. Universal Intermodal Services Inc.\u2019s Dundalk location currently has at least 12 truckers out of work, according to fleet manager, RJ Martin.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really screwed up the trucking market in this whole area as guys are no longer working in this area,\u201d Martin said. \u201cThey\u2019re having to go somewhere else or just be out of work and try and collect unemployment \u2013 which not everyone will be approved for.\u201d\nMartin said that mass cancellations result in rerouted shipments to ports in Virginia and New Jersey. Many customers decided to cancel trucking orders with Universal\u2019s Baltimore facility and are instead scheduling with Universal\u2019s other locations or other carriers closer to the new drop-off locations, Martin said. He said out of 50 orders, about 30 have been canceled and of the remaining 20, about 10 were rerouted.\nA mix of government agencies and private contractors are trying to clear wreckage from the Port of Baltimore.

(Photo by Dylan Burnell, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers)\nAbout 10 truckers from Universal have gone down to Norfolk to register with the port there to pick up rerouted shipments, according to Martin. He said other Baltimore-based truckers also have to register in Norfolk to pick up loads. This additional clearance has added five to six hours to many of the truckers\u2019 days.\nMartin is hopeful that once the Baltimore channel is cleared and the port reopens, operations for Baltimore shipping companies will return to normal. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said it hopes to have the Port of Baltimore partially reopened by the end of April and fully open by May.\nOther businesses don\u2019t face such a severe economic impact, but they consider the loss of the Key Bridge as an important symbolic moment for the community. For Brandy Teresi, 48, co-owner of Robbie\u2019s Bar and Grill in Sparrows Point, the Key Bridge was \u201ca part of your identity and who you are as an individual, which is weird because it\u2019s just a bridge.\u201d\nThe only small immediate impact for Robbie\u2019s Bar and Grill has been rerouted deliveries. One quirk: the supplier of the bar\u2019s CO2 tanks, which pump the beer taps and soda machines, needs to go around the city because regulations don\u2019t permit the tanks in the Harbor Tunnel on Interstate 895, Teresi said.\nOther businesses across the city are still navigating the uncertainty that comes with the collapse. Canton-based Mama\u2019s on the Half Shell has not experienced any direct economic impacts, but some customers from Anne Arundel County have a longer drive to the restaurant, said Maurico Guevara, a veteran employee at Mama\u2019s. The restaurant planned to hold a fundraiser on April 10 and donate a portion of their profits to victims of the collapse, he said.\nMegan Gardner, marketing director for the restaurant group that owns Mama\u2019s, doesn\u2019t predict any problems with food shipments since they obtain their food from local suppliers. The biggest impact is emotional.\n\u201cFeeling that communal heartache is more of how we felt,\u201d Gardner said."},

A search-and-rescue operation was launched and Gov. Wes Moore declared a state of emergency.\nWhat\u2019s the historical significance of the Francis Scott Key Bridge? Here\u2019s what you should know:\nHistory of the bridge\u2019s name\nThe bridge was named after Francis Scott Key, the American lawyer who wrote the lyrics of the Star Spangled Banner.\nThe site of the bridge is believed to be within 100 yards of where Key saw the bombing of Fort McHenry on Sept. 12, 1814. The American flag was raised on Sept. 14, 1814 to celebrate the key victory over British forces, which scholars believe inspired the words \u201cbroad stripes and bright stars\u201d in the national anthem.\nBridge construction\u00a0\nConstruction for the 1.6-mile-long Francis Scott Key Bridge started in 1972 and it opened to traffic on March 23, 1977. The New York Times reported that the bridge cost $141 million to build, which is roughly $743 million in today\u2019s dollars.\nIn the early 1960s, the Baltimore Harbor Tunnel had reached its traffic capacity and motorists encountered heavy congestion and delays almost daily during rush hours. The state concluded that there was a need for a second harbor crossing and started on plans for a single-tube tunnel under the Patapsco River, but price proposals were substantially higher than the engineering estimates. Officials then drafted an alternative concept of a four-lane bridge which would become the final link for the Baltimore Beltway I-695, according to the Maryland Transportation Authority.\nThe steel bridge is the outermost of three toll crossings of Baltimore\u2019s Harbor. Including its connecting approaches, the bridge project is 10.9 miles in length. Other structures along the beltway include a dual-span drawbridge over Curtis Creek and two parallel bridge structures that carry traffic over Bear Creek near Bethlehem Steel\u2019s Sparrows Point plant, according to MDTA.\nHow many people use the bridge?\nThe bridge carried more than 12.4 million passenger and commercial vehicles in 2023, according to a Maryland state government report issued last November.\nThe Key Bridge allows for more traffic lanes than the Baltimore Harbor Tunnel and has lower operating and maintenance costs. In addition, it provides a route across the Baltimore Harbor for vehicles transporting hazardous materials, which are prohibited from both the Baltimore Harbor and Fort McHenry tunnels, according to MDTA.\nAlong with the Fort McHenry and Baltimore Harbor Tunnels, the Key Bridge provides convenient and safe transportation for local and interstate traffic.\nImpact of the collapse\nWith the collapse of the Key Bridge, vessel traffic in and out of the Port of Baltimore has been suspended.\u00a0\nMaryland\u2019s Port of Baltimore handled a record 52.3 million tons of foreign cargo and 11.7 million tons of general cargo in 2023, according to a statement by Gov. Wes Moore last month. It ranks first in the nation\u2019s ports for volume of autos and light trucks, handling about 847,000 cars and light trucks in 2023. The Port of Baltimore generates about 15,300 direct jobs, with nearly 140,000 jobs linked to port activities.\u00a0\n\nMore coverage:\n\u2022\u00a0Biden administration ready to release money for Baltimore bridge accident\n\u2022\u00a0After Bridge falls, Baltimore mourns a city symbol\n\u2022 Distress call precedes disaster at Baltimore bridge\n\u2022 Baltimore\u2019s Key Bridge collapses after ship collision\n\u2022\u00a0Vessel traffic through the Port of Baltimore has been suspended indefinitely\n\u2022\u00a0Key Bridge\u2019s collapse adds to list of U.S. bridge disasters"},

However, economists are skeptical about the stadium's potential to significantly impact the economy, citing examples where similar projects have had limited success in revitalizing struggling urban areas.", "content": "HAGERSTOWN \u2013 The new ballpark under construction here is the latest effort to bring baseball back to a town that has a rich history tied to the game. But the project is also an attempt to revitalize a city core that has been deteriorating for decades.\nThe ballpark\u2014a project sought by local leaders for two decades\u2014will serve as the home to a new minor league baseball team that will be a member of the Atlantic League. The stadium will also host other sporting and cultural events.\nEver since the Maryland General Assembly approved funding for the $70 million stadium in 2021, local officials have touted the project as the long-awaited catalyst that will spark Hagerstown\u2019s turnaround.\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at ways to reinvent our economy,\u201d Paul Corderman, a Maryland state senator who ran for office with the goal of tapping state funds for his hometown, said.\u00a0\nHe added that officials are hopeful that the stadium will \u201cprovide a little added\u2026..incentive for individuals to want to invest.\u201d And that, he believes, will bring people back downtown, igniting a renaissance.\nBut whether the new stadium will transform the city\u2019s downtown into a vibrant city center is far from certain. Interviews with realtors, businesses and government officials showed a divide in the level of enthusiasm for the stadium. Many economists argue that ballparks rarely generate enough economic activity to turn around an ailing economy, especially in places like downtown Hagerstown where homelessness and drug addiction are pressing problems.\u00a0\nMinor league stadiums \u201creally don\u2019t have a great fiscal impact,\u201d Gary McGuigan, an executive vice president at the Maryland Stadium Authority, said.\nHowever, McGuigan added that there can be significant \u201cspeculative development\u201d beyond a ballpark itself. McGuigan pointed to Lancaster and York, Pennsylvania, cities within 125 miles of Hagerstown, where minor-league\u00a0ballparks recently have been built in or near downtown. In both places, he said, \u201cdevelopment has occurred all around and it\u2019s been viewed as a success.\u201d\n The stadium authority\u2019s role in the Hagerstown project was to produce economic and cost studies on potential projects, and then issue bonds to finance the projects approved by the state legislature. Once the authority presented its report, the legislature decided on the project\u2019s future based on economic viability or political reasons, McGuigan said. The state\u2019s history of funding minor league stadiums and Corderman\u2019s advocacy are what ultimately led to the legislature approving the project, he said.\n\u201cWe were all actually surprised when they got funded,\u201d McGuigan said. \u201cIt\u2019s like an amazing feat and hats off to the local senator who advocated for it.\u201d\nUnlike convention centers, which bring visitors from out of town who spend money on hotels and restaurants for several days, minor league stadiums attract locals who attend games that last a few hours. Stadiums don\u2019t increase spending in towns; they simply \u201cmove it around,\u201d sports economist Dennis Coates said. New stadiums don\u2019t increase people\u2019s spending on entertainment, so if they attend a baseball game, they\u2019re not spending their money at a local restaurant or movie theater. Coates added that because the new Hagerstown team will be unaffiliated with a Major League Baseball team, it may not have the advantage of a star player on a rehab assignment or an up-and-coming prospect to draw crowds.\u00a0\nYet\u00a0 as stadium construction proceeds\u2014the ballpark is expected to be completed in the fall of 2024 \u2014 there are signs that the Hagerstown metropolitan area is already starting to see an economic uptick. While the trigger for the growth is partly related to the return of baseball, other trends may be playing a bigger role, including the rise of e-commerce, low real estate costs and the growing popularity of a nearby interstate highway.\n\u201cI think that the Covid pandemic and its focus on industrial development, e-commerce provided us the leverage to draw the attention (from investors) that we\u2019ve been dying to have,\u201d said Jonathan Horowitz, director of business development in Washington County, which includes Hagerstown. While he\u2019s optimistic about the prospects for the county overall, he\u2019s not sure about the city\u2019s downtown.\u00a0\nHagerstown, a city of 43,000 people, is located in northwestern Maryland near the borders of Pennsylvania and West Virginia. The city was once one of the state\u2019s largest due to its development as a transportation hub. Multiple freight and passenger railroad lines run through the city. However, when passenger service was halted and factories closed or reduced staff, Hagerstown\u2019s economy started to contract.\u00a0\nToday, Hagerstown is among the poorest cities in Maryland with a poverty rate of 25.5%, more than double the statewide average of 10.3% and the nationwide average of 11.6%, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. The median household income in Hagerstown was $42,965 in 2021 compared to $91,431 for the state overall.\n\u201cI understand that we might not be as economically fruitful out here as some of the others are, but we have a lot to offer out here and I think they\u2019ll see it as a good economic opportunity out here,\u201d said Scott Nicewarner, Hagerstown\u2019s city administrator.\n\nhttps://cnsmaryland.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Hagerstown-Stadium-Site.mp4\nAn overhead view of the construction of Hagerstown\u2019s new baseball stadium from April 2023, one year before the ballpark is set to open. (Tim Jacobsen/Philip Merrill College of Journalism)\nIndeed, businesses started giving the Hagerstown area a second look during the pandemic,\u00a0 a year before the state approved funding for the stadium. As more Americans started shopping online, retailers such as Amazon needed additional warehouse space near their customers and along major highways. In the mid-Atlantic region, the Hagerstown area became an increasingly popular location, due to the low cost of real estate but also to its proximity to Interstate Highway 81, which some logistics and transportation companies were starting to favor over the more crowded Interstate Highway 95.\n\u201cWe experienced a wave of land purchase that I\u2019ve never seen anywhere in my career,\u201d said Horowitz, who estimates that land prices jumped from about $70,000 an acre a few years ago to about $150,000 an acre currently.\nDoug Reaser, Hagerstown\u2019s economic development manager, estimates that warehouse and industrial companies will bring in about 7,500 jobs and about $1.2 billion in total investments between 2019-2024.\nThe residential real estate market is also improving. According to real estate brokerage Redfin, the median sale price for a single-family house in Hagerstown was $265,500 in March. While that is about 66% higher than it was in March 2018, it\u2019s still significantly lower than the state average of $378,900. And homes are selling faster. Since March 2018, the median number of days a house stays on the market has fallen from 83 to 37 days.\u00a0\nThe rising demand, according to real estate brokers, is led by families and individuals looking for affordable housing and strong schools. Many are relocating from Washington and Baltimore metro areas, where the cost of living is higher. Hagerstown \u201cis very commuter-friendly and taxes are lower in Washington County,\u201d said Debra Moser, a real estate agent for RE/MAX. \u201cBut it\u2019s still within commuting distance,\u201d to Washington and Baltimore.\nShirley Bayer, a real estate agent for RE/MAX, said more out-of-towners are showing up at open houses. \u201cUsually around 15 people is a good turnout for an open house, and that\u2019s higher than it used to be,\u201d Bayer said. \u201cThe main attraction for moving here is cheaper prices and lower taxes.\u201d\nMeanwhile, some businesses are starting to tiptoe into the troubled downtown area. Hub City Brewery,\u00a0 a new 22,000-square-foot brewery and taproom, is under construction and expected to open in late 2023 or early 2024.\u00a0\nWhen Hub City Brewery owner David Blackmon ventured into Hagerstown, he originally wanted to use the space for production.\u00a0\n\u201cI was introduced to the building by city employees and it was a perfect fit for production, but it is so large and in a central downtown location it just made sense to open another taproom as well\u201d said Blackmon.\u00a0\nBlackmon currently owns two other breweries in Maryland and believes that the new Hagerstown location has the potential to grow larger than both.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cI see a lot of amazing things happening in Hagerstown. The growth is crazy at the moment.\u201d\nLISTEN: Neighbors voice cheers and jeers for the new ballpark.\n\nhttps://cnsmaryland.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Hagerstown-Audio.mp3\n(Dylan Manfre/The Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism)\nHub City Brewery is not the only restaurant expansion in the area. According to Blackmon, there will be a new strip of stores and restaurants, including two additional new breweries.\u00a0\n\u201cUltimately it\u2019s not as much about baseball as it is the experience. If you offer a good entertainment opportunity for all ages, I think that\u2019s where the interest will be,\u201d Nicewarner said.\nIn expectation of increased traffic, Hagerstown\u2019s Museum of Fine Arts is expanding. The museum expects to pull visitors not just from Hagerstown but from the region as well.\n\u201cWithin a 60-minute drive, putting the museum in the center, going 60 minutes in any direction, there\u2019s about 1.5 million people,\u201d said Roger Fairbourn, former president of the museum\u2019s board and owner of Roger Fairbourn Real Estate.\u00a0\nThe project will provide more space for art classes, youth programs and more.\u00a0\nThe Maryland Theatre, another historic Hagerstown attraction, just built a five-level Performing Arts Center, which can hold larger gatherings and support bigger events at the facility, according to its website.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s doing great things that are going to become very popular resources in the community,\u201d Fairbourn said of these expansions.\nApartment developers, meanwhile, are vying for space. Dan Spedden, President of the Hagerstown/Washington County Convention and Visitors Bureau, estimates that five residential projects are under construction in the downtown area. He said around $80 million was invested in private investments towards these projects.\u00a0\n\u201cAll of this is because of the stadium,\u201d Spedden said.\u00a0\n\u00a0Still, there are lingering concerns about the long-term success of the new stadium, considering its location. Horowitz worries that the presence of \u201cvagrants and panhandlers\u201d who frequent downtown to receive social services creates a potentially unwelcoming environment that might deter people from visiting the area.

(Bridget Byrne/The Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism)\nKelly Rajahpillay has lived in Hagerstown for 22 years and works at the Presbyterian Church of Hagerstown on South Prospect Street, a little more than a city block from ballpark site. She sees the impact of drugs and homelessness on her drive to work each day and believes that the city should focus on uplifting individuals in need rather than building a ballpark downtown.\n\u201cOur town is in dire need of realigning itself. We\u2019re just putting Band-Aids\u201d on the problem, Rajahpillay said. \u201cI\u2019m not seeing the progress. It\u2019s like two steps forward, 10 steps back.\u201d\nRajahpillay also worries about traffic. She already sees increased congestion when The Maryland Theatre puts on shows and said the traffic would be \u201ccrazy\u201d if the theater and the ballpark were being used simultaneously.\nPotomac Towers, a high-rise apartment building for older residents, overlooks the construction site, where baseball will be played starting next April. On a recent weekday, Richard Livengood, 75, wore a blue NASCAR hat as he went out the door of apartment building. He said his only sports interest is NASCAR.\nSean Griffith, the Hagerstown Housing Authority\u2019s executive director, said the Potomac Towers residents have \u201cmixed emotions\u201d regarding the ballpark, with some residents clamoring for baseball\u2019s return and others worried about the ramifications of the ballpark.\n\u201cI think some are really excited, you know \u2013 big baseball fans are excited to have a stadium right across the street,\u201d Griffith said. \u201cOthers are concerned about possible traffic issues and maybe noise concerns.\u201d\nHe added that the Housing Authority has been in contact with the team owners who said that they are open to talks with residents about the impact of traffic and noise.\nSecurity near the ballpark will also be a topic for discussion among neighbors.\nCorinna Nelson of nearby Greencastle has owned a skin care center in Hagerstown for 14 years. \u201cI don\u2019t have children but if I did have children we would not take our children to a ballgame and then walk to a parking lot in Hagerstown at night,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying you\u2019d get murdered, but you don\u2019t need to get mugged either.

He foresees change when fans begin coming downtown for ball games. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see storefronts filled up with businesses. You\u2019re going to see empty buildings with upscale apartments. The whole scene changes,\u201d Spedden said.\nRecent statistics reveal that crime rates in Hagerstown are the highest in Washington County. However, reported crimes in the city have fallen, according to information contained in the Uniform Crime Reports from the Maryland State Police.

Yet it\u2019s been hard to convince young people to move to a place known as the epicenter of the 2015 uprising following the death of Freddie Gray, who died from injuries suffered in police custody.\nPeople are hesitant to make a home when the house next door is boarded up. It is hard to compare that with the flower pots, sharp brick buildings and shady trees in Bolton Hill, just a short walk away.\u00a0\n\u201cYounger people who have options don\u2019t want to move into a community with a lot of vacancy,\u201d said Dan Ellis, executive director of the Neighborhood Housing Services of Baltimore.\nMondawmin, about 3 miles northwest of the Camden Yards baseball stadium, had a vacancy rate of about 14% in 2020, well above the citywide rate of nearly 8%, according to the Baltimore Neighborhood Indicators Alliance (BNIA).\nWalk two miles east and you enter Bolton Hill, another world. The vacancy rate is about 1% and the income is about double that of Mondawmin. The average Bolton Hill resident had a per-capita income of $45,263 in 2020 versus $24,625 in Mondawmin.\nAmong the reasons for the disparity are the history of segregation and lack of investment in Mondawmin and other mostly Black neighborhoods, said Bill Hamilton, secretary of the Bolton Hill Community Association and editor of the Bolton Hill Bulletin. One example of that history was a 1979 survey that showed the 13 biggest lenders in Baltimore provided only 1.6% of their mortgage loans to majority Black census tracts, author Antero Pietila wrote in the book, \u201cNot in My Neighborhood: How Bigotry Shaped a Great American City.\u201d\nAndrea Limauro, a former Baltimore City Department of Planning official, said the racial discrimination feeds into wealth inequality, an issue that cities like Baltimore cannot solve on their own. \u201cI think it\u2019s a national and federal issue that should really be tackled by national policies,\u201d Limauro said.\nThe community faced additional challenges after the violent protests and property damage following the death of Gray, the 25-year-old Black man who died from injuries suffered in police custody. Many Baltimore residents, especially in Mondawmin, lost confidence in the police after Gray\u2019s death, Hamilton said. Homicides and shootings remain high citywide since Gray\u2019s death.\u00a0\nEven though the city\u2019s population is falling, Baltimore in 2021 saw more than 300 homicides for the seventh straight year, The Baltimore Sun reported.\u00a0\nDevelopments are being made in the city and in terms of how police deal with violence, but progress is slow, said Hamilton. This means most of the crime rates in Mondawmin and the rest of the city have stayed the same.\nThe Mondawmin community faces major changes as many of the neighborhood\u2019s elderly residents leave or pass away. \u201cThere\u2019s a generation of people aging out of the community,\u201d said Mario Chang, 45, president of the Korean Business Association. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of transitioning happening in the area.\u201d\nAbout 19% of Mondawmin residents are age 65 and older, above the citywide rate of 14%, according to BNIA. Ellis, of Neighborhood Housing Services, agreed aging out is a major problem. An aging community with vacancies does not encourage new residents. Ellis said Neighborhood Housing Services wants to eliminate vacancies in Greater Mondawmin, now at 14%, by the end of the decade. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty ambitious,\u201d he said.\nSometimes when an elderly person leaves their home, their family takes over the house and moves into the neighborhood, providing a boost to the community, said Jacqueline Caldwell, a community advocate in the Greater Mondawmin area. This new blood could explain why one census tract saw income per capita increase by almost $10,000 between 2010 and 2020.\nJacqueline Caldwell, community advocate in the Greater Mondawmin area. Photo by Esther Frances.\nSeveral people interviewed said growth is likely to continue because Mondawmin is one of the only areas citywide that has many attractions \u2014 a mall, a busy subway station, a college, schools and big homes \u2014 all in one place. \u201cIt has the ability to be an archetype of what urban renewal and revival can be,\u201d said Franklin Lance, senior pastor of Mount Lebanon Baptist Church and president and CEO of the Parks & People Foundation.\u00a0\nLance sees the age of Mondawmin residents as an asset, one that makes the neighborhood stable and less transient. \u201cIt has more homeowners, people tend to pass down their properties through generations, they\u2019re less likely to move,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, it is a more stable community than some others.\u201d\nTo work toward bettering Mondawmin, Lance said the community needs an influx of capital, which can be accomplished by implementing tax increment financing, known as TIFs, which allow local governments to invest in public infrastructure developments and pay for them later.\nDespite some of the issues in Mondawmin, Caldwell said there are bright spots that are often hidden because the community suffers from \u201cmedia genocide. Nobody knows about all the good things that are happening,\u201d she said.\nCaldwell said many partners come and develop in Mondawmin because they see assets in what she calls \u201cone of the greatest communities in Baltimore.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t call my neighbors \u2018residents.\u2019 You know, we call each other family here,\u201d Caldwell said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very tight-knit community with a lot of assets.\u201d"},

Individual incomes top out at nearly $42,000 in 2020 for some, while others earn half as much, according to a Capital News Service analysis of census data. But neighboring Midway is much worse off, where the top individual income was $22,464, and many were below the federal poverty line of $27,750 for a household of four, according to federal poverty guidelines.\nMartenczuk, 41, said the St. Vincent de Paul Society at the Shrine of the Little Flower church tries to help as many people as it can, but there are limits. They used to hand out $40 food vouchers to people in the community, but had to stop since it was costing the church too much money. If their church can\u2019t help out, they will direct people to where they can get assistance, he said.\nStill, the Shrine of the Little Flower church acts as a bridge for those trying to survive in a community growing in prosperity. Residents of the city appreciate the faith-based leadership and community-based activism. They feel that Baltimore has left them behind and in the dark.\u00a0\nCommunity leaders are determined to improve their struggling neighborhoods on their own and are done waiting for the city to do something.\u00a0\n\u201cStop doing all the talking. If you\u2019re going to talk, walk that walk,\u201d said Roland Johnson Jr., leader of R&J Ministries of God in East Baltimore.\nThe need in Midway is great. A Capital News Service analysis showed residents in parts of Midway saw their incomes fall $533 between 2010 and 2020, while other parts of the neighborhood saw incomes rise by $5,474. That\u2019s well below the citywide averages, where\u00a0 per-capita income reached $32,699 by rising $9,366 from 2010 to 2020.\u00a0\nNeighboring Belair-Edison fared much better. Per-capita income rose between $2,000 and $18,000 in the 10-year period, according to a Capital News Service analysis of census data. The reasons for the disparity between Belair-Edison and Midway are numerous, ranging from abandoned housing to lack of city investment, according to interviews. One major theme was the prominent role churches and faith leaders were playing to help build up these neighborhoods.\nJohnson, 50, leads R&J Ministries of God, even though he has no physical church building and no car. Still, he tries to do whatever he can to give back to his East Baltimore community. This includes giving away clothes and food, which Johnson said he distributes from a wagon while walking around the Midway neighborhood.\u00a0\nJohnson said he does this with little to no help. Johnson and his wife Justina, 55, said they want support from the city not only for their own organization but for their entire community. Justina Johnson said she has called the city twice about recycling pickup and that no one responded.\u00a0\n\u201cWe got two houses in front of us that are empty,\u201d Justina said. \u201cPeople just throw trash like\u00a0 mattresses or chairs or whatever in the alley.\u201d\nNearly 20% of properties in Midway are vacant and abandoned, according to the Baltimore Neighborhood Indicators Alliance (BNIA). By contrast, just 3% of properties are abandoned in Belair-Edison.\nAnother Midway activist, Kathy Christian, 53, said the city could do more to inform residents about \u201chow to navigate the system.\u201d\nChristian, executive director of the Midway Community Development Corporation, said one common question involves what to do after your trash can gets stolen. A simple answer from the city could help with trash collection in the neighborhood. The city\u2019s current communications system, which often requires people to navigate websites, is a barrier for elderly residents, she said.\u00a0\n\u201cJust because someone doesn\u2019t make a lot of money doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not intelligent,\u201d Christian said.\nYounger people feel challenges as well, said Charles Brown, 57, of the East Baltimore Graffiti Church. The high school completion rate for the area is 75% while citywide the rate is 78%, according to BNIA. In neighboring Belair-Edison, the graduation rate is nearly 82%. While there are now more opportunities for African Americans, there is still a long way to go for Brown\u2019s neighborhood.\nThe East Baltimore Graffiti Church gave away free haircuts at their annual church fair. Photo by Olivia Wolfson.\nBrown, who has lived in Midway for seven years, said the school system is also failing its students by not teaching them important life skills regarding financial literacy such as renting a house or staying employed in a job.\nEllen Janes, 67, executive director for the Central Baltimore Partnership, said more programs for young people are a top priority. The partnership, which attempts to revitalize 11 neighborhoods including Midway, helped create a summer youth workshop, which included a session at The Voxel theater, where young people learned about the business and could create their own videos. \u00a0\u00a0\nWhile The Voxel theater program drew younger teens, a bigger problem involves getting older youth to participate in organized activities.\u00a0\n\u201cKind of hate to say it, but they disappear,\u201d Janes said. \u201cThey don\u2019t come to community centers, they don\u2019t come to community events and they\u2019re not at school, so they\u2019re tough to serve.\u201d\nStill, Janes is working to reach the older youth through various employment programs and career support.\nThe Central Baltimore Partnership is collaborating with community associations and nonprofits on other projects, such as creating community green spaces, creating youth programs, and supporting women- and Black-owned businesses. The group serves as a coordinator for about 100 organizations to work on these projects.\nThe Central Baltimore Partnership also runs a Community Spruce-Up program that seeks to revitalize community spaces ranging from restoring vacant lots to rebuilding playgrounds. One example is a community park project with Cecil Elementary School, which is located in Midway. The project will create two playgrounds, a sports field, improve stormwater mitigation, create an outdoor classroom for the school and create a new space for the community, said Aaron Kaufman, 33, the partnership\u2019s community projects manager. The first phase of construction is expected to start in January, Janes said.\nSupport poured into the Midway community through the East Baltimore Graffiti Church\u2019s Fall Festival on Oct. 29. Attendees received free meals, jackets and haircuts while their kids could play carnival-style games. Since it was a church-sponsored event, some activities required people to listen to a sermon before getting game and meal tickets.\nBrown, the church\u2019s pastor, seemed welcome at the event, with children running to embrace him.\nCommunity leaders fault city and state officials for making poor investment decisions. For example, the state is building a parking garage on property in Barclay, a project that doesn\u2019t help create ongoing jobs for the community, said Brad Schlegel, 72, from the Barclay, Midway and Old Goucher Coalition. He said the neighborhood instead needed better supermarkets since not everyone has access to a car and there are few good stores in the area.Instead, they got stuck with a parking garage.\n\u201cIt seems like that is at the fait accompli, which the community didn\u2019t really have a whole lot of input in,\u201d Schlegel said."},

The neighborhood has a pedestrian mall that now has decaying buildings, giving it the feel of a ghost town.\u00a0\nYet Erin MacDonald, who works for the Old Town Mall Merchants Association, believes there are a lot of misconceptions about the neighborhood.\n\u201cIt just seems like this area gets lied about a lot,\u201d MacDonald said. \u201cThere are a lot of times when I talk to people about this area and they\u2019re like, \u2018Oh I didn\u2019t even know there were businesses open there. I didn\u2019t know that anything was still thriving out there.\u2019\n\u201cThere are people living their lives here, and trying to run businesses.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nInstead of helping the Old Town businesses, MacDonald said the broader concern is \u201cmaking sure they don\u2019t get in the way of \u2018progress.\u2019 \u201d\u00a0\nIn the area around the Old Town Mall, the per-capita income was about $12,100 in 2020, below the federal poverty line. Residents in Old Town struggle much more when compared to surrounding neighborhoods such as Little Italy, where the per-capita income was more than five times higher at $65,834.\nHowever, Old Town has a lot of history and is close to downtown. The city officials envision a redevelopment that includes new parks and commercial centers, although recent development plans have yet to commence.\u00a0\nOld Town is home to about 9,000 people and consists mostly of rowhomes and multifamily buildings, with 86% of residents renting properties, according to Live Baltimore. The estimated average rent per month is $1,235 and the median home purchase price is $82,000. The Baltimore riot of 1968 occurred there as well, contributing to much of the area\u2019s decline.\u00a0\nThe Old Town Mall is a central feature. At its peak, the mall was a thriving shopping center with 64 stores, including Goldstein\u2019s Style Shop, the Diplomat Shop and Kaufman\u2019s, and was known as Gay Street, according to Atlas Obscura. After the 1968 riot, the revamped area was renamed Old Town Mall, and was restricted to only pedestrians. However, Old Town deteriorated by the 1980s due to unemployment and poverty, and census data shows it is one of the poorest parts of the city.\u00a0\nWanda Watts, who represented the city\u2019s health department on the steering committee for the Old Town redevelopment plan, sees wealth inequality as a struggle for the city. \u201cIt\u2019s a historical problem. It\u2019s not anything new. It\u2019s been going on since the end of the Civil War, and it has not changed,\u201d Watts said.\u00a0\nThe lack of public transportation is one reason for the wealth disparity, Watts said. \u201cWe do not have a transportation system that will allow people to look for jobs outside of the city. They\u2019re relegated to just looking inside the city unless you have a car,\u201d Watts said.\u00a0\nMacDonald said redlining and gentrification are other causes of wealth inequality. MacDonald described \u201cthe continued segregation of poor into increasingly poor areas\u201d and then a process of gentrification where development will serve \u201cnot the people who already live there but for wealthy people to either come back to the cities or retreat to the suburbs.\u201d\nGentrification is a process that happens when wealthier people move into poorer areas and start changing the neighborhood by improving housing and attracting businesses, most of the time displacing some of the original residents. Redlining is a process that existed in cities to racially categorize neighborhoods, and although it was outlawed, the effects can still be seen in many places, including Baltimore.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nPhilip Leaf is a professor emeritus at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said wealth inequality has many origins. \u201cEverything from multigenerational violence and racism to young people having to look after their younger siblings, and therefore losing out on opportunities for themselves,\u201d said Leaf, who also is on the board of My Brother\u2019s Keeper Baltimore, an organization that focuses on empowering young men of color.\u00a0\nLeaf said a possible solution involves determining what systems and institutions perpetuate wealth inequality. To start, \u201cyou have to acknowledge there\u2019s a problem,\u201d he said.\nRon Miles, president and CEO of RJY Chick Webb Council, said the process of investing and building up neighborhoods is \u201cdefinitely a slow, selective process, and not very equal.\u201d The Chick Webb recreation center was one of the first recreation centers built for the city\u2019s African Americans.\nAn example of this selective process is the Harbor East-Little Italy area. Development in Harbor East, an affluent waterfront neighborhood, spilled into Little Italy, said Doug Kendzierski, deacon at St. Leo\u2019s church in Little Italy. As Harbor East developed, \u201cit attracted a lot of diversity and a lot of young, urban professionals who are living there, which would necessitate a higher income,\u201d Kendzierski said.\nLittle Italy, a historic neighborhood where Italian immigrants settled in the 1800s, is known for its strong Italian culture and traditions. Little Italy\u2019s per-person income rose by $32,442 from 2010 to 2020, according to census data."},

We read many things, including \u201cNot in My Neighborhood\u201d by Antero Pietila, which documented the deep history of systemic residential, social and political discrimination and bigotry in Baltimore. With bus trips to urban farms, presentations about property tax issues and tours of some of the oldest streets and sites in town, we became well-versed in the plight ailing the almost 300-year old city. Then we began reporting.\u00a0\nOver the course of the past two and a half months, our team of five Capital News Service reporters interviewed dozens of Baltimore residents and visitors and took photos and videos. WYPR hosted our team for a lunch where their seasoned journalists advised us about interview and storytelling techniques and gave us ideas about how to best paint the picture of wealth inequality in Baltimore.\u00a0\nThe five of us found a common theme in our reporting. We all heard a tale of hope and promise for the future of Baltimore.

The zones are the intersections of President Street and Jones Falls Expressway/Interstate 83, Conway and Light streets, Mount Royal and North avenues,  Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and Interstate 395, Wabash Avenue and Northern Parkway and Sinclair Lane and Moravia Road\n\nA second measure recommended by the collective included the provision of up to a year of financial support for squeegee workers who enter workforce education, training and entrepreneurial programs. Conditions specify that the worker must stay enrolled in the program for the entire year and commit to stop squeegeeing.\n\u201cAchievable solutions were finally brought to the table,\u201d Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott said. \u201cThe very people so many people want off the street are able to get the support they need.\u201d\nSqueegee workers have been a contentious issue in Baltimore for more than three decades. The workers gather on busy Baltimore street corners and offer to clean motorists\u2019 windows during traffic stops in exchange for money.\nSome view them as ambitious youth, some as young as 10, with a creative way to earn money.\u00a0 Others see them as a nuisance, clogging traffic and at times threatening motorists who decline their services.\nTensions were pushed to the flashpoint following the July 7 murder of Timothy Reynolds.\u00a0\nReynolds , 48, was shot and killed at the corner of East Conway and Light streets by a 15-year-old squeegee worker after, police say, Reynolds attacked the kids with a baseball bat following a confrontation.\u00a0\nThe squeegee worker was arrested and charged with first- and second-degree murder as well as assault and gun-related charges. His legal team rejected a plea deal in October that would have given him a 60-year prison sentence.\nReynolds\u2019 family is suing Baltimore, claiming that the city\u2019s failure to stop illegal behavior put Reynolds in danger.\nThe location of Reynolds\u2019s murder falls within one of the proposed anti-panhandling areas.\nAdditionally, a Baltimore man was charged in October with two counts of attempted\u00a0 murder after, police say, he shot two squeegee workers in May while looking for the workers he believed scammed his mother of over $2,000 using Cash App.\nJason Williams, a Baltimore middle school teacher, said the squeegee workers are being painted with too broad a brush.\n\u201cSome of these workers are kids just trying to get enough money to eat for the day,\u201d Williams said in an interview with Capital News Service. \u201cNot every squeegee worker is the same.\u201d\nWilliams said many of his students use squeegee work as a summer job.\u00a0 He also has students who miss days at school to work on city streets to make money for them and their families, he said.\n\u201cThese workers are just like everyone else, just out here trying to do what they can to survive,\u201d he said.\nScott created the Squeegee Collaborative in July, shortly after Reynolds was killed.\u00a0 The group includes a collection of youth, business leaders, community members and elected officials.\u00a0 Their plan was developed over several meetings between its members.\u00a0\nScott and the newly-elected Baltimore City State\u2019s Attorney, Ivan Bates, have been on opposite sides of the issue.\nScott has said what squeegee workers do is considered panhandling, which is protected free speech under a U.S. Supreme Court ruling.\nBates has said the workers are breaking the law, and he has no problem with handing out citations.\u00a0\n\u201cTo me, there\u2019s a difference between panhandling, holding a sign very quietly in an area, not going in and out of traffic,\u201d Bates said during a television interview last month. \u201cGoing in and out of traffic is an action, and I believe that action is illegal.\u201d\nThe state\u2019s incoming governor, Wes Moore, so far has not taken a stance on what could ameliorate the situation.\n\u201cWe need to be able to ensure that we get kids off the corners, because they\u2019re not safe,\u201d Moore said in an interview on MSNBC. \u201cWe know you cannot criminalize poverty.\u201d\u00a0\nBates and Baltimore City Police Department Commissioner Michael Harrison were part of the team that created the plan, Scott said .

Phinn said in her ruling, prosecutors withheld evidence crucial to Syed\u2019s defense.\nShe gave the state\u2019s attorney office 30 days to decide whether to proceed with a new trial or to drop the charges. Charges were dropped after the office tested DNA evidence in the case, which it said confirmed Syed\u2019s innocence.\n\u201cThe results of the DNA testing exclude Adnan and include what Adnan and his supporters have always known; Adnan Syed is innocent,\u201d said Erica Suter, an assistant public defender and Syed\u2019s attorney. \nIn a virtual press conference following the news of Syed\u2019s release, Suter, also the director of the Innocence Project Clinic in Baltimore, said it is too early to begin thinking about compensation for Syed.\n\u201cAdnan plans to spend time with his loved ones,\u201d Suter said. \u201cHe is elated to be able to have the small, quiet, everyday joys of freedom that many of us take for granted.\u201d\nSyed is currently pursuing a degree at Georgetown University, she said, and has hopes to become a lawyer.\n\u201cHe wants to know, like the rest of us, what really happened,\u201d Suter said.\nSyed\u2019s case is officially over in the circuit court, she said. \nAn appeal by the Lee family of Syed\u2019s release to the Court of Special Appeals is still pending.\n\u201cWe extend our deepest sympathy to the family of Hae Min Lee, and we join in the hope that an investigation will bring them real answers and a sense of closure,\u201d Suter said.\nSyed returns to a neighborhood markedly changed from when he left. Capital News Service spoke to several of his neighbors and none knew of the man who has achieved national prominence living just doors away from them. Most had just recently moved to the community.\nGaskins is one of the few left. For more than 20 years, she followed his case closely.\n\u201cI just hope that they can find some peace,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause he is 40-something now, and all his adult life has been (in prison), and I hope the best for him.\n\u201cI\u2019m just so thankful that at last it\u2019s over.\u201d"},

The advisory is still in effect for neighborhoods in West Baltimore north of Route 40.\nWater contamination has been an issue for residents of Baltimore communities for some time. City and state officials have come under fire from residents and advocacy groups, with many describing the city\u2019s water and sewage system as aging and claiming that water main breaks and sewage leaks are common and lead to water contamination.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been like this my whole life,\u201d, Sandtown resident Elijah Harris, 38, said, \u201cBack then, it was that it was lead paint  in the water.

She, her husband and their three kids then set to work cleaning up the remains of sewage, bits of toilet paper, condoms and other debris that spilled into their home.\n\u201cIt was all hands on deck to kind of get everything clean,\u201d Bock-Singleton said.\nAfter having to throw away her contaminated Shop-Vac, ceramic tiles and replacing the bathroom drywall, she invested $30,000 into installing backflow prevention valves into her home\u2019s lateral sewer line to prevent future backups.\nIt was the first time her home had flooded with sewage.\nThousands of Baltimore residents report sewer backups into their homes each year. In an effort to address the problem, the city launched a reimbursement program in April 2018. The program, run by the Department of Public Works (DPW), allows residents to request reimbursement from the city for sewer backup cleaning costs, up to $5,000 for a given backup.\nSewage backups reported to 311 in 2020, over time\n\nSource: Baltimore\u2019s open data portal. (Matt McDonald/Capital News Service)\nYet few apply to this program, and only a small fraction of those who do see a payment from the city. The eligibility requirements of the program result in the majority of applications being rejected, a Capital News Service analysis found.\nSince the program began in April 2018, only 120 requests for reimbursement have been filed by residents as of March 24, 2021, according to data obtained by CNS through a Public Information Act request. Of those requests, only 19 were ever approved.\nDuring the same time period, the city received more than 18,700 reports to its 311 service related to sewage backups in homes, according to records obtained by CNS through the city\u2019s public data portal. Residents reported more than 7,000 backups in 2020 alone.\nBaltimore receives thousands of reports of sewage backups in homes every year. To ease the financial burden of cleanup costs from these backups, it began a reimbursement program in 2018. But few apply to this program and even fewer receive payment from the city.\nWhen asked about the low number of applicants to the program, Yosef Kebede, the DPW\u2019s acting head of Water and Wastewater, admitted the city\u2019s outreach efforts weren\u2019t robust when the program began in 2018.\n\u201cI can see why that raises eyebrows,\u201d Kebede said.\nHe said communication has since improved. For example, he said, the DPW sends out reminders about the program on social media when heavy rains are forecasted.\nBock-Singleton\u2019s home backed up again later in 2018 after two inches of rainfall pushed sewage past the backflow preventers. This time, she applied for reimbursement from the city. She was rejected, she said, because the city found a stick in her sewer line.\nThe reimbursement program only covers cleanup costs if DPW investigators determine that the sole cause of the backup is a wet weather event. Though it had rained more than two inches the day before Bock-Singleton\u2019s backup, the stick in the line disqualified her.\nAging infrastructure\nSewage backups in homes are part of a larger problem: Baltimore\u2019s sewer infrastructure is old and overburdened.\nThe city\u2019s sewer system is more than a century old. The pipes are in places cracked, misaligned, or otherwise faulty. Those faults allow storm and groundwater to flood into the sewer lines, leading to sewage backups.\nOther issues can also cause or contribute to overflows, including blockages caused by tree roots or products improperly flushed down the toilet, such as baby wipes and menstrual products.\n\u201cYou quickly reach a threshold where the system is overwhelmed,\u201d said Marccus Hendricks, the director of the Stormwater Infrastructure Resilience and Justice Lab at the University of Maryland.\nIt is a combination of \u201cvulnerable infrastructure systems, increasing development, and, because of climate change, more frequent and intense wet weather events that are coming to a head that are causing these overflows and backups, not only in Baltimore, but in cities across the country,\u201d he said.\nBaltimore\u2019s sewer system has long dumped human waste in places it doesn\u2019t belong. Relief valves built decades ago have directed sewage overflows into rivers and tributaries leading into the Chesapeake Bay. The city reported overflows totaling nearly 50 million gallons of sewage mixed with water in 2020 alone, almost all of it into the Jones Falls.\nA sewer outfall off of the Jones Falls Trail on May 8, 2021. Millions of gallons of sewage mixed with water flowed from structures like these into Jones Falls in 2020. (Matt McDonald/Capital News Service)\nThe city has poured over $830 million into stopping overflows and improving sewer infrastructure since an agreement it struck in 2002 with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Justice and the Maryland Department of the Environment. That agreement, called a consent decree, headed off the threat of a lawsuit from the agencies, which alleged the city was violating the Clean Water Act by polluting waterways.\nAs the city closed relief valves, sewage backups in homes began to happen frequently. There were 622 backups in 2004, according to The Baltimore Sun. There were more than 5,000 backups each year in the decade leading up to 2015.\nThe city\u2019s response\u00a0\nThe city created the Expedited Reimbursement Program as part of a modified consent decree negotiated after the city failed to complete its sewer overhaul by the 2015 deadline.\nThe program only covers clean-up, disinfection and disposal costs related to \u201ccapacity-related wet weather events,\u201d defined on the DPW website as when at least a quarter inch of precipitation within 24 hours causes \u201csewer lines to surcharge or overflow.\u201d\nHomeowners and tenants can apply for reimbursement by filling out an application online, by email, or by mail. Applicants must provide supporting documentation, including copies of receipts for cleaning and disinfection costs. Residents whose applications are rejected can still file a general liability claim for property damage to the city\u2019s law department.\nThe city denied about 84% of applications it has received since the program\u2019s April 2018 start date \u2014 101 out of the 120 submitted by residents. (Four applications were rejected because they related to backups that had occurred before the program began.) The most recent application in the data reviewed by CNS was received in February 2021.\nAbout 23% were denied because they did not report the sewage backup within 24 hours of it occurring, a requirement until July of 2020. Even after lifting the 24-hour reporting requirement, the city went on to reject more than 80% of applications.\nThe city has paid out less than $20,000 to applicants since the reimbursement program began, according to the program data. The consent decree set the annual funding for reimbursements to \u201cat least $2 million.\u201d\nAsked why there are so few payouts, Kebede said that the bureau\u2019s budget, which is funded by resident water bills, necessitates a limit on how the funds are used.\n\u201cThe denials are based on procedures and protocols that we have to follow and be consistent with,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody feels good about that.\u201d\nCity Councilman Kristerfer Burnett sponsored a bill that would require the DPW to study the expedited reimbursement program and a related program and report on whether it would be feasible to allow the programs to cover all sewage backups, not just ones caused by wet weather.\nBurnett said that his constituents experience backups caused by both wet weather and dry weather. The programs also have issues with equity, he said; cleanup costs for backups hurt those that are struggling with income the hardest.\n\u201cThere\u2019s just some criteria [in the programs] that I think still doesn\u2019t go far enough to serve our citizens,\u201d he said.\nFamilies struggle with sewer backups\nThe city rejected claims if investigators found an obstruction such as rags, grease, debris or roots in the sewer line. In such cases, a wet weather overload was ruled out \u2014 even if it had rained right before sewage backup.\nThat happened to Dorothy Conaway, a retired educator who has lived in her home on Belvieu Avenue for nearly 47 years. During a phone interview, she read from the denial letter she received from the city in response to her reimbursement application for a July 25, 2018 backup.\nDorothy Conaway at her home in West Baltimore on May 8, 2021. Conaway\u2019s reimbursement application was rejected even though it had rained four inches the day before she experienced a sewage backup in 2018. (Eric Harkleroad/Capital News Service)\n\u201cThe agency investigators responded to your incident and determined that the incident was not caused by surcharging in the sewer collection system due to wet weather, but caused by rags and debris that were removed from the sanitary sewer main line,\u201d the letter said. \u201cAnd it says \u2018see attachments,\u2019 which I never got,\u201d Conaway added.\nIt had deluged more than four inches in the city the day before on July 24, the second wettest day on record.\nOn May 27, 2018, the same day torrential rains pelted down across the state of Maryland, flooding the streets of Ellicott City, Rachel and Nicky Mutinda\u2019s West Baltimore home filled with sludge from the sewers.\nThe city found that the sewer lines had surcharged, reimbursing the Mutindas for $1,000 of the $2,500 they had requested because insurance had covered part of the costs, according to the program data, making them one of 19 households approved for reimbursement.\nRachel Mutinda said she thinks that she and her husband found out about the city\u2019s reimbursement program from an article shortly after the backup.\n\u201cIt is not obvious where to find this information,\u201d Nicky Mutinda said.\nRachel Mutinda said following an application all the way through to success took a combination of persistence, internet savvy and the freedom to be able to follow up with the city during the workday.\n\u201cNot everybody has that ability to have that persistence,\u201d she said.\nExposure to human waste can be very dangerous; it can carry parasites, viruses and bacteria, Christopher Heaney, an environmental epidemiologist and associate professor at Johns Hopkins University, told city councilmembers at a hearing on sewage backups in 2019.\nA sign warns pedestrians to not touch the sewage-contaminated water on the Jones Falls Trail in Baltimore as cyclists ride past on May 8, 2021. (Eric Harkleroad/Capital News Service)\nAnd the moisture from sewage backups can lead to the growth of mold, fungi and other harmful microorganisms, Heaney added \u2014 \u201ca huge concern for individuals who have respiratory health problems.\u201d\nLeah Brown worries about the health of Tierney, her six-year-old daughter, who has asthma.\nTheir home has been inundated with sewage multiple times, seeping up from the basement shower drain and into the home Brown shares with her husband, Tony Murray, her daughter, and two teenage sons in Howard Park. After one such occasion, a contractor found black mold as they cut away at the basement walls.\nThere was \u201cso much\u201d of it, Brown said. \u201cThat part was really scary.\u201d\nOn March 23 this year, Mayor Brandon Scott and the DPW announced a one-year pilot program that would have the city contract with third-party cleanup services directly and send them to the people experiencing backups. With the reimbursement program, residents need to pay for cleanup and then request reimbursement. For the new Sewage Onsite Support (S.O.S.) Cleanup Program, the city pays for third-party cleanup services and sends them to the people reporting backups \u2014 if they qualify. (The S.O.S. program does not replace the reimbursement program; residents can choose between the two.)\nOnce investigators determine a resident\u2019s backup was caused by wet weather, they\u2019ll ask if the resident would like the city to dispatch a cleaning service to their home. Kebede said he hopes the S.O.S. program\u2019s simplified process will let it reach more residents. He said that the program had so far helped five people, at the time of the May 5 interview.\nBrown\u2019s home filled with sewage again the day after the Mayor\u2019s announcement. When she called 311, the city didn\u2019t inform her about the existence of either cleanup program, Brown said. Instead, she heard about them from a member of Clean Water Action, an advocacy group.\nBrown\u2019s entire house smelled of excrement. Tierney couldn\u2019t be there anymore. Brown took her to her neighbor to watch after her. One of Brown\u2019s sons tried to help clean but grew so nauseous he nearly vomited. Her other son, Chandler, spent his sixteenth birthday cleaning up sewage in the basement bathroom.\nIt rained more than one and a half inches the day of the backup, breaking a record for rainfall on March 24. But when Brown spoke with city officials about the S.O.S. program, she was told she didn\u2019t qualify \u2014 DPW investigators had found roots interfering with the main sewer line and the pipe leading to her house.\nBrown said it seemed to her like the city is dodging accountability for its century-old sewer infrastructure. Her basement has never backed up with sewage on a sunny day, she said \u2014 only when it rains \u2014 and yet the city blamed roots.\nBrown was hopeful about the new cleanup program when she learned of it. But she expects most people will end up with experiences like hers.\n\u201cOn paper, if I\u2019m sitting here looking at it, I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh, this looks great,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cBut then once you start to read the fine print, that\u2019s when you start saying, \u2018Oh, it really doesn\u2019t help me.\u2019\u201d"},

Raymond Thompson, one such resident, faced losing his home but managed to pay off his debt through a benefactor, highlighting the systemic issues many are struggling with.", "content": "Some low-income homeowners in Baltimore may be at risk of losing their homes due to the city\u2019s tax sale system and the ongoing burdens of the coronavirus pandemic.\nRaymond Thompson, 63, recently received a letter from Baltimore City telling him that his home would be included in an upcoming tax sale if his property debts weren\u2019t paid by April 30.\nFor the last decade, he has lived in Baltimore City, where he cared for his mother, who struggled with dementia until she died in 2018, Thompson told Capital News Service.\nSoon after her death, he was granted the property but for several months lived in fear of losing his home to the Baltimore City tax sale system.\nThompson said he was eligible for a property tax credit and filed it with the city, but that paperwork was lost.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been really annoying, I did everything I needed to do,\u201d Thompson told Capital News Service.\nThe property tax credit would have covered the property fees, but due to the delay in paperwork, interest on the tax bills accumulated.\nThompson said he has been struggling to find work because of the lack of jobs, and with his underlying respiratory health issues, it makes him specifically vulnerable to the coronavirus.\n\u201cThe pandemic has kept me from getting enough money to pay for the taxes,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to put myself out there right now without being vaccinated.\u201d\nFortunately, Thompson was able to pay off his tax bills through a benefactor, he said, however, others have had to endure the complexities of the Baltimore City tax sale system.\nBaltimore City\u2019s tax sale system has particularly affected specific demographic groups \u2014 African-American communities, households making less than $30,000 per year, older adults and people with disabilities \u2014 according to advocates and tax sale experts.\nEvery year, there are a number of people who don\u2019t pay their property taxes or other related bills and these unpaid debts are known as liens. These properties include owner-occupied, non-occupied resident and commercial properties.\nThe pandemic has only made it harder for property owners to pay off their debts.\nIn Baltimore City, any residential property owner who owes more than $750 in property-related taxes can have their liens on the property go up for auction, according to the report.\nDuring a typical tax season, local jurisdictions auction off these liens and the highest bidder is given a certificate of ownership.\nThese bidders are typically private companies that target homeowners for their debt and additional fees, which are a money-maker for them.\nAmy Hennen, managing attorney for consumer and housing law with the Maryland Volunteer Lawyers Service \u2014 a nonprofit organization that connects low-income individuals facing financial hardships from tax sales with volunteer attorneys \u2014 said the tax sale system incentivizes private investors.\nA handful of companies invest millions of dollars into the tax sale system, buying liens on indebted homes, Hennen said.\nThe bids start at 18% of the property tax owed, according to the Baltimore City Department of Finance. A debt of $3,000, for example, could be purchased for $540, or more.\n\u201cThey target homeowners because they are much more likely to pay off their property taxes because of the risk of losing their home,\u201d Hennen said.\nA homeowner may recover their property after paying the debt holders. However, the debt may increase because of interest and fees, according to tax sale experts.\nIf a Baltimore City homeowner doesn\u2019t pay their debts in nine months after the tax sale, the investor may file in Circuit Court to foreclose on the home, tax sale experts said.\nDuring the 2020 tax sale, there were a total of 10,067 property liens offered for sale among the state\u2019s 24 jurisdictions, and Baltimore City had the most property liens offered for sale with 5,651 liens.\nThere were over $81 million in total lien sales in 2020, and the average debt was $14,000 in Baltimore City. For owner-occupied properties in Baltimore City, the average lien, on 1,015 properties, was $5,709.\nThe Office of the State Tax Sale Ombudsman, Maryland\u2019s new tax sale office, was contacted by at least 835 homeowners during the first half of 2020 about assistance dealing with the tax sale system.\n\u201cWe expect these numbers to increase as more homeowners become aware of our service,\u201d the report states.\nHennen said there needs to be a better system in place that would include an automatic renewal of property tax credits, annual payment plans and a system more focused on equity.\nProperty tax credits are life lines to low-income households, and these credits would supply homeowners with additional funding to pay off their debts, according to Hennen.\n\u201cThese folks are pillars of the community; these homeowners need to be prioritized over the influx of cash,\u201d Hennen said.\nMaryland lawmakers are trying to help these vulnerable communities in the upcoming tax sale season, which begins in May.\nHB252, sponsored by Del. Robert B. Long, R-Baltimore County, would defer owned residential property from tax sales for the next two years.\nThe bill would allow all 24 local jurisdictions to withhold owner-occupied property from tax sales starting June 1, 2021, through June 30, 2023.\nAnne Arundel County recently announced that they were deferring the annual tax sale season until 2022.\nLong said he brought this bill forward because of the financial hardship that is burdening the state\u2019s residents, and he doesn\u2019t want anyone to lose their home.\n\u201cPeople are losing their jobs and losing income,\u201d Long said. \u201cThe last thing we want to see is someone losing their home, especially in today\u2019s pandemic.\u201d\nThe Maryland House of Delegates passed this bill unanimously on March 10, and the Senate Budget and Taxation Committee held a hearing on the legislation on Thursday."},

The Maryland Food Bank, a non-profit hunger-relief organization, saw its distribution rate increase by 96% over last year\u2019s rate between March and October. It spent $17.5 million dollars on food in that timeframe \u2014 a 371% increase compared to last year.\nThe number of Baltimoreans receiving aid through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program rose 22% between the start of the pandemic in March and August, city officials said.\nCity government has expanded its services, but communities have also taken it upon themselves to meet the growing need. Neighborhood leaders, many of whom have been feeding people for years, have found themselves working harder and giving away more food. \n\u201cThere\u2019s so many less opportunities for people to get a good meal,\u201d said Carolyn Anewich, the spearhead of Soul Kitchen. \u201cAnd there\u2019s so many more people that need a good meal.\u201d\nSandtown-Winchester\nOn the sidewalk outside First Mount Calvary Baptist Church on Saturdays, volunteers stack cardboard boxes filled with produce, from apples to squash, across a strip of folding tables. People arrive in cars or by foot to pick up food to take home. No one is turned away.\nBefore the pandemic, the church served hot meals from its soup kitchen once a week and distributed produce boxes once a month. Now, this Sandtown church hands out food six days a week \u2014 including lunches three times a week, hot meals once a week plus produce boxes on two days.\n\u201cThe pandemic has created what everyone is calling a perfect storm, because now you have children who are out of school who would normally only eat when they\u2019re in school,\u201d said the church\u2019s pastor, the Rev. Derrick DeWitt, who is also the president of Clergy United for the Transformation of Sandtown (CUTS). \u201cYou also have the lack of transportation or people afraid to use public transportation, and if they could afford to go grocery shopping, getting there is a problem.\u201d\nThe Rev. Derrick DeWitt is pastor of First Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Sandtown-Winchester (Photo by Kamisha Walker/Capital News Service)\nThe church and its members have long been dedicated to providing food to the community, and before the pandemic, they relied completely on their own donations and grant money to do so, said Roxane Prettyman, the church\u2019s outreach coordinator who does much of the cooking and distribution of food. With the ballooning need, the church partnered with CUTS and other nonprofit organizations to expand its services. \nThe church volunteers work with Food with a Focus, a fund created to provide food during the pandemic, to deliver food boxes to families of four every two weeks. A nearby urban farm, which the church helps run, provides produce for meals the church gives to older residents twice a week. The Angel Foundation and the Maryland Food Bank provide food to the church as well. \nOther nonprofits and other churches help sponsor the work. Guinness Open Gate Brewery even donates bread.\nHow does the church pay for the rest? \u201cWe beg. A lot,\u201d DeWitt said \u2014 for donations, for grant money, for sponsorships from wealthier suburban churches. \n\u201cI go to the suburban churches and I say, \u2018You know you don\u2019t have the problems we have, but you can help us,\u2019 \u201d DeWitt said. \n\u201cBetween our networking, our partners and contributions from our church members, we\u2019re able to keep going.\u201d\nKim McCoy Hopkins, who lives on the city\u2019s west side,  came to the church on a Saturday morning this fall for food. \n \u201cIt\u2019s a blessing,\u201d she said.\n \u201dTimes are extremely hard with this economy and people being laid off. It\u2019s just a mess, trying to pay your mortgage, trying to pay your electric bill, trying to pay your water bill.\u201d\nMcCoy Hopkins is a disabled veteran and has been unable to work since she left the service in 1999. She used to rely on family to make ends meet but can\u2019t anymore. Four of her extended family members were laid off recently. \n\u201cI have had to make sacrifices\u2013 many sacrifices, like not being able to buy food,\u201d McCoy Hopkins said. \nOther community members use the church\u2019s services to help those around them who have trouble getting out. Denise Reid, for example, has been doing this since 2012 and has carried  food to older residents in particular during the pandemic. \nReid continues to do this work despite not having an easy time herself. In October, her nephew was killed. This month is also the anniversary of the death of Reid\u2019s son, who was shot dead in 2006.\n\u201cFortunately, with tragedy, comes triumph,\u201d Reid. \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to share the love and support of other families.\u201d\nSandtown was in the headlines five years ago as the home of Freddie Gray, who died after being injured in police custody. Within all 74 square blocks of this predominantly Black neighborhood, there are 109 places to buy liquor and no grocery stores, DeWitt said. Sandtown, like many similar areas, has historically been neglected. \n\u201cThese communities continue to be marginalized due to systemic racism over long periods of time, and I don\u2019t think the government, whether it be local, state or federal government, has paid enough attention to what is the cause of these problems and how to fix it,\u201d  DeWitt said. \u201cIf you lay the poverty map over the redlining map, they\u2019re almost identical. It\u2019s a long period of systematic racism that has led us to where we are now.\u201d\nOnly about half of residents 16 to 64 in Sandtown-Winchester were employed in 2018, according to census data collected by the Baltimore Neighborhood Indicators Alliance. The pandemic has only worsened unemployment in the area, as many residents work in the service industry and have been laid off, DeWitt said. \n\u201cYou add that to the lack of access to healthcare, lack of access to food, lack of access to transportation, the fact that African Americans and people of color are more likely to have additional health problems,\u201d DeWitt said. \u201cIt has created a real definite need for the increase in services as it relates to food.\u201d\nNorth Baltimore\nFor six years, Carolyn Anewich has been in charge of Soul Kitchen, a mission of the Govans Presbyterian Church that feeds people a hot gourmet meal once a week. Anewich not only runs the mission but is the head chef and publicist as well. She and her team of volunteers make it happen each week without pay. \nCarolyn Anewich cooks gourmet hot meals for guests at Govans Presbyterian Church (Photo by Sandy Banisky/Capital News Service)\nAnewich says she knows what it is like to be hungry. In the past, she says, she had her own struggles. A Baltimore resident for 14 years, she\u2019s seen more people in her community in need of food.\n\u201cThere\u2019s always been a need,\u201d said Anewich. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine a time where there won\u2019t be a need for what I do.\u201d\nWhen COVID-19 cases began to ramp up in March, Govans Presbyterian Church was forced to close.\nDuring the first two weeks the church was shut, Anewich worried about the people who relied on her program. \u201cPeople need food,\u201d she recalls thinking. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to do something.\u201d \nHer team began buying and packaging non-perishable foods to distribute. \u201cMaybe SpaghettiOs aren\u2019t the greatest thing to eat cold, but you can,\u201d said Anewich.\nBefore COVID limited Soul Kitchen, Anewich worked with 20 or more volunteers a week, including students from Loyola University. The team could chop and dice vegetables for scores of meals in 30 minutes or less. Others prepared the church hall for dinner, organizing tables and chairs so that guests could mingle and build a sense of community. \n\u201cWe always would have tablecloths and real glasses and real silverware and real plates. Basically, it\u2019s like going to your mom\u2019s or grandma\u2019s for dinner.\u201d\nSoul Kitchen, Anewich says, is not only about feeding people but connecting her volunteers to the others in the community. \n\u201cIt\u2019s a way to get to know people you wouldn\u2019t know otherwise.\u201d\nBut the COVID-19 pandemic ended this weekly gathering. Now, Anewich works in her commercial kitchen with only one other person, standing at opposite sides of the kitchen. Chopping vegetables can take her hours.  Because of the need for social distancing, no more than seven volunteers are allowed to help package and serve the food each week. \nShe\u2019s been back in the kitchen since June, when other community programs began opening up.  Now, guests come to a table outside the church hall to pick up hot meals packed in recyclable containers.\nOn a recent Sunday, the menu included beef curry with a cucumber salad, macaroni and cheese with balsamic brussels sprouts, and ham with a green-bean-and-potato salad. Each guest received three hot meals in one shopping bag \u2014 one for now, two for later.\n\u201cShe is so determined to make sure that people eat, have a good hot meal every single week.\u201d said Sandi McFadden, a community school coordinator in Govans.\n\u201cShe does not take any shortcuts,\u201d McFadden said. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t use lesser quality food because she\u2019s dealing with people who are downtrodden. If you could see the quality of what she serves to the guests, you would think you were coming out of a gourmet restaurant somewhere.\u201d\nAnewich spends  $100 to $150 a week on meals for her community \u2014 the money budgeted by the church. That money is raised through individual donations or fundraisers, though because of COVID, the church was unable to hold its fundraiser this fall.\nTo make the most of the money, she buys food from grocery stores like Aldi, or Restaurant Depot, a wholesale food supplier. Trips to the grocery store happen once a week and take more than two-and-a-half hours before she gets back to unpack and store the goods in the church refrigerators. \n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty remarkable,\u201d said the Rev. Tom Harris, the Govans Presbyterian pastor. \u201cShe\u2019s really great at either finding deals or finding donations. People in the community have just been very generous and Carolyn\u2019s nurtured a bunch of connections along the way.\u201d\nAnewich will often buy from other non-profit organizations, including the urban farm in Sandtown-Winchester that First Mount Calvary Church helps run.\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much cooperation between the nonprofits and the different groups,\u201d Anewich added. \u201cAs things get better, I\u2019m hoping that all these relationships can still be there.\u201d\nEast Baltimore\nMeal distribution at Henderson-Hopkins School started as a stopgap when the COVID-19 pandemic shut down schools, leaving children without access to regular meals. Within weeks, the staff transformed the program to feed the rest of the East Baltimore community as well.\nHenderson-Hopkins opened eight years ago, the first new public school to come to the East Baltimore area in two decades. The school, a partnership of Johns Hopkins University and the City of Baltimore, teaches pupils grades pre-K through eight, with African American children making up 98% of the student body. \n\nIn March, after pandemic forced closings,  Baltimore City Public Schools designated meal sites across the city to allow pupils to pick up the breakfast, lunch, snack and dinner they would have had in school. Henderson-Hopkins was one of them.\nPeter Kannam,  the Henderson-Hopkins principal, decided to go further, expanding the program beyond the children to the rest of their families.\n\u201cOne thing that I noticed when I became the principal is food insecurity is a real issue,\u201d Kannam said. \u201cThere is not a grocery store within walking distance. It\u2019s a food desert. Where do people get food?\u201d\nThe rise in hunger caused by the pandemic inspired Henderson-Hopkins to build partnerships with organizations and businesses such as the Maryland Food Bank and Coastal Sunbelt Produce. These relationships, as well as a $30,000 donation from Johns Hopkins University, allowed Kannam and his team to get groceries to the school\u2019s families and others in the area.\nAbout $5,000 a week brought the school team 10,000 pounds of food \u2014 fresh fruits, vegetables and canned goods all ready to be packaged and distributed by staff and volunteers on Fridays.\n\u201cFascinating things happened when we started doing this,\u201d said Kannam.\nHe told the school families on social media that groceries would be available once a week. But word spread through the community.  Cars pulled up one after the other, the line going for blocks, and people waited on the sidewalk. \n\u201cWithin an hour, it was all gone,\u201d he said.\nThe school was feeding about 250 to 300 families each week. But he was curious about how many of them were families of Henderson-Hopkins.\n\u201cI started tracking it and it was about 30 families that were coming out of 300.\u201d Kannam said. \u201cWhat I realized immediately\u2026we weren\u2019t even advertising to the broader community but there was such a demand and need.\u201d\nTo be sure that families of Henderson-Hopkins pupils were receiving food, he offered them delivery.  A hundred families signed up, he said.  \nMaria Delcid, a stay-at-home mother of three, walks to Henderson-Hopkins and every week to pick up food for her children and family. Her children, 1, 5 and 12, are all pupils at the school.\n\u201cThe pandemic has affected our family economically. Sometimes my husband\nworks and sometimes he doesn\u2019t,\u201d Delcid said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an easy process to get the food,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause the people that work there already know me, so they always have my box set aside for me when I go.\u201d\n\u201cThe work that they\u2019re doing here\u2026I think it\u2019s tremendous,\u201d said Bea Cook, who heard about the program through word of mouth. \u201cThey\u2019re feeding people that really need to be eating.\u201d\nTo keep the program going, the school team has had to raise funds by seeking grants or individual donations. To date, they\u2019ve managed to raise more than $100,000 \u2014 allowing them to distribute over 319,000 pounds of food to more than 9,800 families. \nThey continue to look for money wherever they can. \n\u201cWhen we see a grant that can be used for food distribution, we apply for it,\u201d said Assistant Principal J.D. Merrill. \u201cIt is my sense that there were more resources available for food at the beginning of the pandemic than there are now, which is challenging because the need remains so urgent.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just super proud we started doing this in March,\u201d Kannam said. \u201cWe\u2019re really proud that we\u2019ve kept the food distribution going.\u201d \nBaltimore City\nSeeing an overwhelming need and increase in SNAP requests, the city developed an emergency food strategy that includes distributing food boxes and meals at sites all over the city. \nThis effort involves city agencies, the Maryland Food Bank, companies such as Coastal Sunbelt Produce and Common Market, a regional food distributor, and community and nonprofit organizations. \nBetween April and October, the city provided about 9 million pounds of food boxes and 5.7 million meals at over 400 sites and through deliveries, according to city figures. \nBy Laura Franklin/Capital News Service\nThe Maryland Food Bank has been accepting donations from different companies. Smithfield Foods, for example, has donated more than 450,000 pounds of protein to the Maryland Food Bank between March and November. Jonathan Toms, Smithfield\u2019s charitable initiatives manager, said the crises caused pandemic led them to give \u201cabove and beyond\u201d what they normally donate. \nThe city is also distributing more food to Baltimore\u2019s older adults, who are especially vulnerable to the virus and often are left without a way of getting food on their own. The health department and its partners have expanded their services to provide 1.7 million meals to this population between April and October. \nWhile the city has been able to  cover most of the costs using federal funding from the CARES Act, the stimulus bill passed by Congress in March, this funding is set to expire this month, said James Macgill (cq), who oversees their food services for older adults at the Baltimore City Health Department Division of Aging. \n\u201cThe pandemic has heightened that this issue was there all along, and we need a broader approach,\u201d Macgill said. \u201cIf there\u2019s no additional funding that comes to us, we\u2019re going to have to make some very difficult choices, as to who gets prioritized and who continues to receive meals.\u201d"},

Because of the coronavirus, the city couldn\u2019t staff the more than 300 polling places it did in 2016. Just 24 centers were open yesterday.\nBrandon Scott, now the City Council president and the Democratic candidate for mayor, easily won against Republican and unaffiliated candidates. He will be the city\u2019s 52nd mayor.\nAnd although early voting and mail-in ballots set a record in the state, on Election Day voters were still coming to the polls \u2013 most of them motivated by national issues.\nEmanuel Holley, 35, said he came to vote at Baltimore City Community College because \u201cI want to see Trump out of office.\u201d\nIn July of 2019, President Donald Trump called Baltimore a \u201cdisgusting, rat- and rodent-infested mess,\u201d while attacking the late Rep.

(Rachel Clair/Capital News Service)\nNot everyone was as partisan. The voters also included people worried about the economy and their local communities.\n\u201cWe need stability,\u201d said Kim Fisher, a resident of the Lake-Walker community in Baltimore who took an Uber to the Western High School voting center.\nFisher added she is not happy with the direction Baltimore is heading and is worried about growing crime in her neighborhood.\n\u201cI usually vote in every election,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cI want my voice to be heard.\u201d\nAt Violetville Elementary/Middle School, Jayna Powell was bundled up in a winter coat as she handed out snacks and water to voters. It was windy Tuesday morning, but the Baltimore Votes volunteer says she wanted to thank residents for showing up to the polls. Baltimore Votes is a non-partisan non-profit formed in 2017 to encourage voting.\nPowell was impressed by the determination of some older voters.\nShe said a 94-year-old woman walked to her usual polling location, where she had been voting since the 1940s, only to find her location was one of the many closed this election. So the woman walked a mile and a half to the Violetville school to exercise her right to vote. Powell said they called an Uber to take her home.\nAnd Powell said a 93-year-old man, who had voted in the Pigtown neighborhood his whole life, was surprised to see his polling place closed Tuesday. He also came to Violetville to vote.\nThough they could have voted by mail or voted early, some voters said they just liked participating on the exact day.\n\u201cWe are old school,\u201d William and Stacie Gueron said as they left the Violetville voting center.

He requested a mail-in ballot but said it never came, so he showed up at the college to cast his ballot in person.\n\u201cI don\u2019t pay too much attention to politics,\u201d Johnson said, \u201cbut I know it\u2019s all wrong.\u201d\n[ Marylanders cast Election Day votes on ballot questions ]\nAlmost 85% of Baltimoreans voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election, with 10.5% of the vote for Trump.\nBut the turnout in this election was far higher, in a city where Democrats outnumber Republicans 10 to 1.\nEven Republican Gov. Larry Hogan, who has seen wide popularity across the state, did not carry Baltimore in the last election.\nThe last time Baltimore elected a Republican mayor was in 1963, when Theodore R.

Yet when a shooter fired a gun inside their school on Feb.8, 2019, they were stunned. \n\u201cI did not believe what was going on,\u201d Jaionna Santos said.\n\u201cIt was surreal,\u201d Bryonna Harris added.\nDamani Thomas couldn\u2019t sleep. \u201cWhy did that happen to Frederick Douglass? Why did that happen to us in school?\u201d\nAs they tried to find answers,  the students came to see that the violence that they accepted as inevitable should not be considered normal. So on April 10th, 2019, they told their stories to the Baltimore City Council. Their effort was a catalyst for the Elijah Cummings Healing City Act. \nSigned into law in February, the act requires all city workers, from police officers to teachers, be trained to respond to the trauma they see as they work with Baltimoreans. \nIn helping to draft the bill, the three students say they learned about government. They  learned they were leaders.\nAnd they realized something else: They came to understand how deeply they had been affected by violence in their own families and how they had to get help in coping. \n\u201cI did not understand the circumstances I was in \u2026 was trauma,\u201d said Santos, 19, who has lost a cousin and a close friend in shootings. \n\u201cOver the years and over the time of living in Baltimore being a student in Baltimore City,\u201d she added, \u201cI learned how to navigate a lot of things and normalize things that I went through.\u201d\nBefore the school shooting, Harris, 17, said, \u201cI was very quiet about my problems and struggles, and I like to go through it alone.\u201d But now, she said, she realizes \u201cI can\u2019t do everything by myself, especially when it comes to trying to heal from trauma because it\u2019s an all-hands-on-deck kind of process.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll three of them have just been through such harrowing, personal challenges in their life.\u201d \n\u2014 Daniel Parsons, Frederick Douglass High School AP English teacher\n\nAfter the gunfire at Frederick Douglass, which wounded a staff member, City Councilman Zeke Cohen called the school\u2019s principal asking how he could help. Cohen also mentioned an upcoming council hearing on violence that affects youth.\nWhen English teacher Daniel Parsons got word of Cohen\u2019s plan, he decided that Harris, Santos and Thomas, whom he knew from his AP language and composition class,  should go to City Hall to tell their stories.\n\u201cIt was almost a natural choice for me to pick all three of them,\u201d Parsons said. \u201cAll three of them are just amazing kids. Their personalities are so incredibly different and all three of them have just been through such harrowing, personal challenges in their life that they never let go of them and never use them as excuses.\u201d\nSo a few weeks later, the three Frederick Douglass students nervously entered City Hall and read their statements to a City Council committee. \n\u201cCrime and violence impact our lives constantly,\u201d Santos said in her testimony. \u201cSome students don\u2019t make it to school because the walk to the bus stop is too dangerous or someone was shot near their usual stop. Sometimes they have to put up with drunk or high people riding the bus with them.  Overage men harass young girls on the way to school.\u201d  \n\u201cWe experience all of this,\u201d Santos said, \u201cbefore the first bell rings.\u201d \nHarris said she watched the council members, saw they were really listening, and relaxed. \n\u201cThey understood what we were saying,\u201d Harris said. \nShe realized she was in a new role \u2014 testifying on behalf of the students who were not yet ready to speak.\n\u201cIf I can just be that one voice or we can just be those three voices to speak up for the voiceless, it matters a whole lot,\u201d Harris said.\nThomas said, \u201cI decided to speak out because I felt like certain kids can connect with me and understand that we do have a voice and can serve our peers and kids that necessarily do not have the strength to speak up for each other.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you actually took the time to really speak to the kids and really understand their lives and analyze them, you will understand they were as affected as me, maybe even more.\u201d \n\u2014 Damani Thomas, 18, Frederick Douglass High School senior\n\nHarris, whose brother was murdered in 2008, now understands that the apathy she used to feel was a manifestation of the trauma in her life.\nShe had felt unmotivated to carry on.  \u201cWhere is my light at the end of the tunnel? It just kind of feels like you\u2019re in this dark place.\u201d\n\u201cWhenever I have trauma, I try to push it to the back of my head and try to convince myself that it is normal and this is everyday life,\u201d Harris said. \u201cBut eventually I became unhealthy because when you keep everything bottled in, eventually it will explode.\u201d\nHer father\u2019s death in 2018 pushed her into depression, and people close to her noticed.\n\u201cIt puts me in moods that sometimes I can\u2019t control and causes me to push the people that\u2019s closest to me away,\u201d Harris said. \u201cI just kind of feel like I have to do everything on my own, even though I really don\u2019t.\u201d\nThe shooting certainly took its toll on Thomas, who suffered from depression and began isolating himself in his room and sleeping for hours. Even before the shooting, Thomas said he was dealing with social anxiety. When in big crowds, he felt everything was moving in slow motion and everyone was watching him. \nHe said his response to trauma\u2014being withdrawn and lethargic\u2014is something other teenagers deal with as well, something he feels adults fail to understand.\n\u201cThey might describe us kids as self-centered, or we\u2019ve got tough shells, or we might not care because of where we come from,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cIf you actually took the time to really speak to the kids and really understand their lives and analyze them, you will understand they were as affected as me, maybe even more.\u201d\nEven after the shooting at Frederick Douglass, Harris still feels school is a safe and comfortable place to be. She believes many teachers care about addressing trauma and about the well-being of their students.\n\u201cTeachers are very supportive. They always pushed us beyond our limits and pushed us to exceed our expectations,\u201d Harris said. \u201cSo I think that\u2019s something that\u2019s really healthy for my mindset sometimes.\u201d\nWith the Healing City Act now law, Harris now feels more willing to see herself as a leader.  \n\u201cI think I took it much more seriously and I was much more willing to take on the challenges of it,\u201d Harris said.\nSantos hopes the Healing City Act will start a downward trend in violence and trauma. \n\u201cIt can slow down violence and trauma because most people don\u2019t even know they are actually traumatized,\u201d Santos said. \u201cThis bill will actually teach them, educate them, what you go through shouldn\u2019t be normal.\u201d\nThomas hopes it will help other students have a bigger voice to express their ideas and concerns.\n\u201cFor kids to have a voice, they can speak up more,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cIt could be more Damani Thomases, it could be more Bryonnas, it could be more Jaionnas\u2026. I want the kids to have a voice.\u201d\nHarris hopes this legislation can set an example beyond Baltimore, which is not the only city dealing with these issues.\n\u201cIt is important to start to focus on [trauma] because it has been ignored for way too long.\u201d  \n\nProfiles \n\nJaionna Santos, 19 \nJaionna Santos, 19 (CNS Photo)\n\n\u201cI would probably call [Santos] the rock,\u201d said Daniel Parsons, Santos\u2019s AP English teacher.  \u201cHer strength really is often in listening and being empathetic and encouraging.\u201d\nSantos said she is shy and has anxiety about speaking in public. She is a former class president but dislikes being called a leader because she dislikes the spotlight. \n\u201cI know people look at me as a leader,\u201d Santos said. \u201cThere\u2019s school people who hold me to a high standard, like administrators and students. Me as a person, I don\u2019t like to have all of that attention.\u201d   \nSantos was diagnosed with depression and anxiety in October 2019 and took four weeks\u2019 leave from her school.  She wasn\u2019t doing well academically and only wanted to stay home.\n\u201cI was not talking to friends and I basically was only going to the appointments with my therapist and psychiatrist,\u201d Santos said. \u201cI just wanted to be by myself.\u201d\nNow that she has been able to understand the trauma she went through, she hopes others in the Baltimore community will get the help they need to do the same. \n\u201cThe main thing I believe in is educating people about trauma and figuring out solutions to actually reduce it,\u201d Santos said.\nSantos\u2019s mother is a pharmaceutical buyer who supports Santos and her 16-year-old sister.  She also has 27-year-old twin brothers.  \nSantos views African American figures in history as her role models, because they overcame so much to achieve their goals.\n\u201cIt gives me hope that I can become something because we had the same background and struggles,\u201d she said.\nIn the fall, Santos will go to Community College of Baltimore County in Essex. She wants to go on to college and become a trauma surgeon.\n\n\n\nDamani Thomas, 18 \nDamani Thomas, 18 (CNS Photo)\n\nParsons sees Thomas as the most artistic of the three students.  Thomas loves drawing and cartoons as well as reading \u2014 fiction, nonfiction,  biographies and autobiographies.\nHe considers himself a leader because \u201cI stayed on the forefront to make [the Healing City Act] possible for the city.\u201d  \nThomas has three siblings.  His father is a security guard and mother is a teacher\u2019s helper. \nThomas\u2019s definition of success is ensuring \u201che lived his life to the fullest and he made sure he grasped every conversation and every lesson he got along the way.\u201d\nThomas said he looks up to the people who have encouraged him, \u201cbecause they made me the person I am today and was able to dedicate their lives making sure that I will fulfill the purpose in my life.\u201d\nHe hopes to go to college to study graphic design or computer science. \n\n\n\nBryonna Harris, 17 \nBryonna Harris, 17 (Photo by Jasmine Jones, courtesy Bryonna Harris)\n\n\u201cI think she is the natural leader of the bunch,\u201d Parsons said. \u201cShe\u2019s incredibly thoughtful, very perceptive and charismatic and persuasive.\u201d\nHarris has always considered herself a kind of leader because \u201cI just see things from a different perspective. I feel like I\u2019ve always been an over-analyzer.\u201d\nHarris also likes to write. \u201cWriting is like having a conversation with myself,\u201d she said.\nShe has 14 siblings \u2014 eight brothers and six sisters. Harris\u2019s mother is a nurse. \n\u201cShe came from a different era than me,\u201d Harris said about her mother. \u201cIt\u2019s like some of the same issues but things just change with time, so seeing her strengths and her resistance when it comes to life is pushing me to strive to be better. I definitely want to provide for my mother and be there for her and do everything for her when I grow up.\u201d\nWorking on the Healing City Act taught Harris to be more ambitious and more persistent in reaching her goals. \u201cI feel everything is like perseverance,\u201d Harris said. \u201cI had the motivation to push through, that I can do better when it comes to school and make a better life for myself.\u201d\nShe said she used to accept violence as part of life but that has changed. \n\u201cI definitely want to go forward with trying to find ways to deal with trauma or address trauma and then heal from it,\u201d Harris said. \u201cI\u2019m not exactly sure how right now, but I know I definitely want to go forth with kindness.\u201d\nHarris wants to study at the University of Baltimore and become a lawyer."},

They do this with the support of Kaiser Permanente.\n\u201cBarbershops and salons have a long history of being places where folks feel safe in discussing needs and wants, and almost like counseling,\u201d said Alma Roberts, Kaiser Permanente\u2019s interim director for community health for Greater Baltimore. \u201cThey\u2019re considered anchor organizations in their communities and have access to the trust of their clients.\u201d\nKaiser partnered with New Beginnings in 2016 to bring health services to the shop. Such alliances often forge relationships with clients that doctors cannot, because they are built on instinctive trust.\n\u201cThere are only so many people you let get close to you, like really close to you,\u201d said Stephen B. Thomas, a health policy and management professor at the University of Maryland\u2019s School of Public Health in College Park.\nThomas leads a team of researchers in the Health Advocates In-Reach and Research (HAIR) campaign. The group is working to mirror the barbershop alliances in Baltimore by building a network of Prince George\u2019s County barbershops and beauty salons to promote public health there.\n\u201cAutomatically, by the virtue of what [barbers] do, you have to let down your shields to let someone touch you\u2026,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cAnd I think when physicians see some of this, they\u2019re envious of the relationship the barbers have with their clients.\u201d\nKaiser has expanded to work with six other barbershops and hair salons in West Baltimore. Three are partner shops, meaning they have health-related trainings in the shops, as well as access to Kaiser\u2019s mobile unit, where the shops\u2019 customers can be screened. The other three businesses are ambassador shops, which don\u2019t offer screenings in the Kaiser mobile unit but do participate in all other activities, Roberts said.\n\nRoberts said the partnership has offered medical screenings and other medical assistance to about 5,000 Baltimoreans since 2016. Kaiser also provides classes and workshops, including weekly wellness and fitness classes and monthly mental health workshops. Kaiser works in collaboration with organizations such as the Black Mental Health Alliance and gymGO.\nIn addition to health screenings, Kaiser trains its partners in managing issues such as mental health, diabetes and chronic diseases. All of its partners and ambassadors are certified in Mental Health First Aid, a national program that teaches how to recognize and respond to mental illness and substance abuse.\nEmotional connections often are made inside barbershops, and Hollins Market barbers fill a huge need. In 2018, the Hollins Market neighborhood ranked fourth-highest in the city in gun-related homicides, fifth-highest in shootings and fourth-highest for the number of narcotics calls for service per 1,000 residents, according to data compiled by the Baltimore Neighborhood Indicators Alliance.\nA \u2018do not enter with mask or hoodie\u201d sign at New Beginnings alerts incoming clients before the COVID-19 pandemic (Photo by Capital News Service)\nNew Beginnings fell victim to such violence when the shop was shot up on Halloween in 2018. Staton suffered a wound to the neck. A bullet lodged into the wall next to his barber station. The bullet hole is still there.\n\u201cI keep that there as a reminder to never take nothing for granted,\u201d Staton said. \u201cI could\u2019ve simply patched it up, but then it\u2019d be gone. And I needed to remember how simple things could change at any given moment.\u201d\nCity Councilman John Bullock said Hollins Market \u201cis still a neighborhood that adds a significant amount of vitality, even compared to some of the neighborhoods that are in close proximity.\u201d New Beginnings is in Bullock\u2019s district. He\u2019s been a client there for nearly seven years. He said he has observed how therapeutic a haircut can be for customers because barbershops are \u201csafe forums to tell our stories.\u201d\nThat sharing works both ways. Staton is in therapy for post-traumatic stress following the shooting at his shop. His openness to treatment helps defy the stigma against mental illness in the African American community, which Mia Smith-Bynum, a family science associate professor at the University of Maryland\u2019s School of Public Health, describes as \u201cpretty pronounced.\u201d\n\u201cWith all the negative stereotypes aimed at African Americans, you layer mental health issues on top of it \u2026 it\u2019s just one more thing that can be used as a weapon to dehumanize African Americans or to diminish them,\u201d Smith-Bynum said. \u201cThat\u2019s where the stigma comes from.\u201d\nDonna Bruce, a beautician for almost 35 years, sees it regularly. \u201cNobody talks about stress, about mental health \u2026 because of the stigma \u2026 you put on your big girl panties and move on,\u201d she said.\nBruce said being a hairstylist, for her, is much more than doing hair \u2013\u2013 she\u2019s also a peer recovery specialist certified by the state of Maryland, specializing in helping with family-related issues.\nShe has an arsenal of resources ready to suggest, such as TurnAround, Inc., for survivors of sexual violence or Dee\u2019s Place for people in recovery.\nBut she said there are times when listening to her clients\u2019 stories takes a toll on her.\n\u201cSome people bring a lot of baggage to the table, and that\u2019s secondary stress that I didn\u2019t even know that I was taking on until I started taking some social work classes\u201d at the University of Maryland School of Social Work, Bruce said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know I was affected by that.\u201d\nEven so, Bruce has built strong relationships with her clients. She talks to them about a variety of issues\u2014 from everyday gossip to addiction and mental health.\n\u201cI\u2019m everybody\u2019s mother,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m Ma, I\u2019m Aunty \u2026 They consider me a family member.\u201d\nStaton has also found family among his clients and people who live in the neighborhood. Marie Snipe chose him to be her son\u2019s godfather.\nSnipe said she met Staton in 1993 when he worked in a shop a few blocks away and she needed help raising her children.\n\u201cI felt guilty because of my past \u2014 me using [drugs] and not being there\u201d for her children, Snipe said. \u201cBut I always told them, no matter what, if anything were to happen to me, they always could go to the barbershop.\u201d\nStaton had food and diapers for her children, and he looked out for other members of the community by offering rides and pitching in to cover bills, Snipe said.\nToday, Snipe is a substance abuse counselor. She works as a liaison to connect Staton\u2019s clients with resources they might need to combat their own addictions.\nThe barbershop \u201cwas a place to go where you needed help, resources, anything they can help you with. They never turn their back on you or judge you for anything,\u201d she said.\nSnipe\u2019s son, Davon Mayo, like many other kids in the neighborhood, helped around Staton\u2019s shop by sweeping and cleaning. He was \u201calways connected to the barbershop,\u201d Snipe said. Mayo died of a gunshot wound to the head in southwest Baltimore in April 2019. He was 25 years old.\nCorner Exterior Sunrise: New Beginnings is a prominent business anchor in the Hollins Market neighborhood (Photo by Capital News Service)\nFor Staton, it\u2019s clear what his shop, and other barbershops, symbolize.\n\u201cThey are the heartbeat and the pulse of the community.\u201d"},

His visit to a hospitalized student, another of the youths he counsels, had delayed him. \nStacked on the passenger seat next to him were campaign signs: \u201cWesley Hawkins for Baltimore,\u201d they read, and \u201cTogether We Rise.\u201d Later that day, he\u2019d be going door-to-door seeking support for a City Council run.  (He ended up losing in the June 2 primary).\nThen he\u2019d have to prepare to attend neighborhood events related to the Elijah Cummings Healing City Act, for which he serves as a community liaison. He\u2019d have to think about the courses he\u2019s taking for a master\u2019s degree, as well as plan for promoting his recently published book. And he still had to make dinner for his little brother.\nWesley Hawkins, 34, is a busy guy. \nAt the heart of his schedule is the work he\u2019s done for nearly eight years: The Nolita Project, the organization he created to help Baltimore teenagers who may feel they need someone to rely on.\nThe Nolita Project, which formally became a nonprofit in 2017, is named in honor of his mother, Nolita Smith, who died in 2015 because, he said, of addiction. He founded Nolita because he knows what it\u2019s like for a child to need support. \n\u201cI\u2019ve lived it,\u201d Hawkins said. \u201cI\u2019m from it. And I feel like if we don\u2019t get out here and take the chance to invest in these children, then what?\u201d\nOn this Monday afternoon in March at The Reach! Partnership School \u2014 just before the coronavirus pandemic shut schools down \u2014  he spent about 45 minutes with three students.  He started the conversation with some joking, then asked about their weekend, their classes, their school assignments and how things were going at home.\nHawkins says he talks to the students \u201con a real level.\u201d  \nAs teenagers growing up in Baltimore, several of Hawkins\u2019 students have endured trauma, including rising senior Larry Thompson, whose older brother is incarcerated. \n\u201cFor certain things, it\u2019s really hard to talk about, like my brother being locked up,\u201d Thompson said to Hawkins during the check-in at the high school. \nThompson said that after knowing Hawkins for nearly two years, Hawkins has become a big brother. \n\u201cI felt more comfortable [opening up to him], and I felt like he\u2019s somebody I could trust,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cI felt like I could really depend on this guy.\u201d\nEach student has responded to trauma differently. Some have become desensitized to the gun violence in Baltimore and battle anger and behavioral issues. Others have developed depression or anxiety from losing loved ones to violence, Hawkins said.\nHe holds an open forum during his check-ins with students, allowing them to say whatever\u2019s on their mind.\n\u201cWe all talk about things we experience \u2026 how you get through them, how you build from it, how you move forward,\u201d he said.\nHawkins said he wouldn\u2019t be in the position to help mentor young people but for an aunt, his grandmother and others who invested in him and offered him hope. \nGrowing up, Hawkins said, his mother\u2019s addiction to crack cocaine caused the family to move around Baltimore often.\n\u201cI\u2019ve lived in abandoned houses as a child. I\u2019ve lived in multiple other people\u2019s homes in the community. I\u2019ve lived on the street before. I\u2019ve slept in cars.\u201d\nHis mother was 16 when Hawkins was born, and she had 11 more children, he said. The youngest is 7-year-old Elijah. Hawkins became his guardian after their mother died, when Elijah was 2.  \nHawkins\u2019 book \u201cDear Nolita: The Evolution of an Addict\u2019s Son,\u201d describes the cycle of problems in his home. He describes his family as being enslaved by trauma. \nHis grandmother, he wrote in his book, had been sexually abused as a child. Her daughter, Nolita, was, too, he said. \nNolita turned to crack cocaine at 15 years old, said Hawkins, who was born the year after. He said she couldn\u2019t resist drugs. \nHawkins was sent into foster care at about 13, and the first year, he was moved from house to house. He said he ran away from all of them. \nHe wanted only to be with his mother, no matter the living conditions. \n\u201cWhen that\u2019s all you know, that\u2019s what you want to be in,\u201d Hawkins said.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/tnlJvGZwfos\n Wesley Hawkins, founder of The Nolita Project, says his grandmother and aunt offered support when his mother could not. (Video by Sydney Clark/Capital News Service) \n \nBut he made it through high school and after graduation worked for about five years as a correctional officer for the Maryland state prison system.  \nHe got an associate\u2019s degree from Baltimore City Community College, but he said it took him more than five years to complete the program because he was so behind academically. His instructors, he said, worked closely with him to push through. \nHawkins received his bachelor\u2019s degree in criminal justice from the University of Baltimore, where he graduated with honors. \nHe is now in a master\u2019s program at Trinity Washington University, studying education with a focus on trauma and Adverse Childhood Experiences, a program that studies the effects of trauma on children.\nWalter Sanders, who grew up in East Baltimore with Hawkins, said his former high school football teammate inspired him to go to college, too.\nHawkins was always positive and a hard worker, Sanders said. \n\u201cHe was always one of the leaders and one of the outspoken members on the team,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cHe was an advocate for a lot of the players and the school in general.\u201d\nJamal Turner, who helps run operations at The Nolita Project, called Hawkins \u201cvery charismatic and well-respected.\u201d\nHe said he met Hawkins on the bus back in ninth grade. They later found out they are cousins.\n\u201cThere was such a genuine charisma about him that drew a lot of folks to him, and he\u2019s also a man of his word,\u201d Turner said. \u201cOutside of the charisma is his dedication in that no matter what\u2019s going on, every single day, he gets up to make an impact.\u201d\nTurner said Hawkins has consistently pushed himself to grow. \n\u201cFor him, I know that he doesn\u2019t feel accomplished or he doesn\u2019t feel like he achieved anything unless something happens within each day,\u201d Turner said.\nWhen Hawkins began promoting The Nolita Project and enlisting young people to join, he didn\u2019t  wait for students to find him. He went to them.\n\u201cIf I don\u2019t go to their school, I go to their job. If I don\u2019t go to their job, I go to their home.\u201d\nBack when Hawkins started his mentoring, he often went to the corner of Belair Road and Erdman Avenue about 6:45 a.m. to talk to groups of students at bus stops before they went to school, encouraging them to avoid the destructive path that could have easily landed him behind bars or in the grave. \nJeremy Babb, who met Hawkins about 10 years ago, said he and Hawkins would sometimes drive around the city looking for students who were skipping school.\n\u201cWe pulled up, saw about six or seven young people just coolin.\u2019 We were trying to give them reasons as to why not to skip,\u201d Babb said.\nHawkins would approach the group and say he was working on a project to uplift and inspire youth in the city.\nHe and Hawkins encouraged the kids to prioritize getting an education over being in the streets. \n\u201cIt was like, \u2018Put the guns down and pick up a book,\u2019\u201d Babb said. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/mov7v71f6_0\n Wesley Hawkins says his strategy is to talk with teenagers where they live or go to school (Video by Sydney Clark/Capital News Service) \n\n\u201cThe Nolita Project is a working project \u2026 a lifelong project that will continue to help youth,\u201d Babb said.\nThe organization, based on Remmell Avenue, has mentored dozens of children in Baltimore, most of them at their schools or while on group activities, Hawkins said. Ten to 15 volunteers help with counseling.\nIn addition to his volunteer work at The Reach! Partnership School this school year, Hawkins said he also established a paid partnership with Fort Worthington Elementary/Middle School to mentor students there, before COVID-19 led schools to close. \nDespite the shutdown, Hawkins has continued The Nolita Project\u2019s work. He said 10 teenagers are active Nolita participants now. \nHawkins and his volunteer staff have supplied Nolita students with gloves and masks and have been advising them on applying for city jobs related to the pandemic. Hawkins has also recruited them for community service projects.\nHe and a Nolita student, wearing masks, have been participating in the #NoOneHungry2020 Food Giveaway at Rising Sun Baptist Church in Baltimore.\nThe Nolita Project was one of the sponsors of the drive, which helped feed more than 800 people in need, according to one of the event organizers, N. Jahiem McNill, youth pastor at Greater Saint John Full Gospel Church. \nMcNill discovered Hawkins on social media three years ago. Since then, McNill said he\u2019s worked with Hawkins at several community and church events before the recent food drive.\n\u201cEverything is good with Brother Wesley,\u201d McNill said. \u201cWe appreciate his services and work within the church and in the community.\u201d \nEarlier this month, when protests erupted after George Floyd died in Minneapolis in police custody, Hawkins led demonstrations downtown as well as one that included thousands on the campus of Morgan State University. \nAfter Hawkins completes his graduate program, he said he wants to learn Spanish so he can work with the Latino community.\nHe wants to continue mentoring children who \u201cjust want to be seen,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve learned is once you attract their mind, you can pierce their heart,\u201d Hawkins said. \u201cYou can\u2019t get to know their heart if you don\u2019t capture their mind first and capture their attention.\u201d\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this article misidentified the city where George Floyd died."},

In February, the Elijah Cummings Healing City Act was signed into law.  It mandates training for city employees so that they can recognize trauma in the people they encounter and then respond with help. Staton, Hawkins and the Frederick Douglass High School students all supported the measure.\nBaltimore City Councilman Zeke Cohen, a former teacher in a West Baltimore middle school, sponsored the bill. He envisions city employees from police officers to school cleaning crews and rec center coaches intervening to get help for people, especially children, who are suffering. For example, instead of writing off a depressed child, coaches at the rec center or janitors in school hallways should try to find that child help.\nBaltimore City Councilman Zeke Cohen sponsored the Elijah Cummings Healing City Act, which requires city employees be trained in responding to trauma they see in the Baltimoreans they encounter.

The home is part of a $669,688 forfeiture order imposed on her in addition to the $411,948 restitution she must repay after her release.\nThe sentence punctuated the spectacular downfall of a major American city mayor whose transgressions made national headlines.\nPugh resigned in disgrace last year after revelations of a scheme that federal prosecutors said began when she was a Maryland senator and continued until agents raided her home and Baltimore City Hall in April.\nOn Thursday, Pugh apologized to the citizens of Baltimore and her supporters during brief remarks to the media, saying she has \u201clearned a lot of lessons.\u201d\n\u201cI will take those lessons with me. I will continue to listen, learn, and I don\u2019t think this is the last chapter for Catherine Pugh,\u201d she said. \u201cI look forward to regaining my strength, my zeal, my love for the people of the city.\u201d\nPugh, a Democrat, pleaded guilty to four charges of tax evasion and fraud in November.\nProsecutors had alleged that she sold thousands of copies of books but never printed enough to actually deliver on the contracts she earned through political connections.\nU.S. District Court Judge Deborah K. Chasanow had to weigh two competing sentence recommendations for the nearly 70-year-old former mayor. Prosecutors had recommended a sentence of nearly five years. Her defense attorneys asked for a sentence of one year and one day. The extra day would have made her eligible for early release based on good behavior.\nPugh\u2019s attorneys argued that the public embarrassment and financial ruin she has already endured, her years of service to the community, and her age should outweigh the crimes she committed.\nPugh told the judge before the ruling that she took \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for her own shortcomings.\n\u201cI am disappointed in myself,\u201d she said. \u201cI did turn a blind eye \u2026 because I did that, my life will never be the same.\u201d\nAt least 77 letters were submitted to the court on Pugh\u2019s behalf. Many asked the judge to consider her \u201chigh moral character\u201d and public service while weighing her crimes. Five people spoke on behalf of Pugh, including Kurt Schmoke, a former federal and state prosecutor and Baltimore mayor, now president of the University of Baltimore.\nProminent Baltimore leaders, church and family members, and mentees like a former security guard, who told the court Pugh\u2019s encouragement was the reason he became a Baltimore police officer, wrote letters.\nKweisi Mfume, who won the special Democratic primary to replace the late Rep. Elijah Cummings in Congress in a heavily Democratic district, suggested in his letter to the court that no jail time might be most appropriate.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know personally if justice is better served by sending her to jail at age 70, or by mandating instead, that she spend several years under court ordered supervision,\u201d Mfume wrote.\n\u201cThis option seems to me at least, to have more value. Her skills and the accumulated knowledge she has gained over the years could be of valuable assistance to those community service groups, charities, and organizations in need of experienced assistance.\u201d\nOther prominent Baltimoreans who urged the court to show leniency included Quincey Gamble, executive director of the Maryland Democratic Party, and David Wilson, president of Pugh\u2019s alma mater, Morgan State University. Wilson told the court the charges she pleaded guilty to have taken a toll.\n\u201cOne thing is certain from interactions I have had with Catherine Pugh: She understands the tremendous mistake she made, which has resulted in the loss of the job that she has coveted for years,\u201d Wilson wrote. \u201cHer mistake has taken a toll on her health and her overall well-being.\u201d\nIn her ruling, Chasanow said she considered Pugh\u2019s past good deeds and age, but saw a disconnect in the positive perception some have of Pugh. She said that she hadn\u2019t heard an explanation for the crimes that made sense.\n\u201cI find it ironic that so many people continue to laud her public work,\u201d Chasanow said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s astonishing to me. I think we are all shocked.\u201d\nIn Annapolis, where Pugh served in the Maryland Senate and House before being elected Baltimore mayor in 2016, some Democratic legislators have called for leniency, including Sen. Jill Carter, D-Baltimore.\nMultiple Republican leaders were unwilling to comment before Thursday\u2019s sentencing, including Gov. Larry Hogan.\nHogan has introduced legislation to increase penalties for public corruption in this legislative session; he declined to comment to Capital News Service through his spokeswoman.\nRepublican leaders in the General Assembly were also not willing to comment this week to Capital News Service.\nSenate Minority Leader J.B. Jennings, R-Baltimore and Harford counties, declined to comment Tuesday, calling Pugh a friend. House Minority Leader Nicholaus Kipke, R-Anne Arundel, also declined to comment, telling the Capital News Service he was worried he would upset other lawmakers.\n\u201cIt\u2019s too hostile around here,\u201d he said.\nHouse Minority Whip Kathy Szeliga, R-Baltimore and Harford counties, was willing, though. She said Pugh deserved a tough sentence.\n\u201cSending a message that corrupt politicians are not above the law is important,\u201d Szeliga said Tuesday.\n\u201dUsing children to defraud people from your power of authority, being a senator or mayor, that\u2019s far worse than what (others convicted of corruption) did.\u201d\nPugh ultimately fraudulently resold 132,116 copies of \u201cHealthy Holly \u201c books to the University of Maryland Medical System and other organizations for a total of $859,960, according to documents filed by federal prosecutors. U.S. Attorney Robert K. Hur said the sentence sends a message to public officials.\n\u201cBaltimore City faces many pressing issues, and we need our leaders to place the interests of the citizens above their own,\u201d Hur said in a statement. \u201cCatherine Pugh betrayed the public trust for her personal gain and now faces three years in federal prison, where there is no parole\u2014ever.\u201d\nIt is unclear when Pugh will have to voluntarily surrender to federal authorities.

To reach a higher level called a \u201cverified host,\u201d a chef must prepare a meal and present it to a BonAppetour employee or ambassador. \nThe website then posts appetizing photos of the chef\u2019s cuisine, provides information to customers about upcoming meals and collects payments from customers in advance through the website. \nOnly after payment is collected does the customer see the address of the dinner event. For its service, BonAppetour charges the host a 15 percent service fee.\nMost other meal-sharing sites operate similarly, although some have more stringent inspections and requirements. Feastly.com, for example, requires all potential chefs to prepare a test meal for the company before they can become a Feastly host.\nWhile meal-sharing platforms have been praised for providing opportunities to amateur chefs\u2014including large numbers of women and minorities\u2014some critics are dubbing them the Airbnbs of the food eatery business. \nAirbnb Inc. operates a website that allows homeowners to rent out rooms or apartments to travelers, in competition with hotels. And just as Airbnb has raised concerns from the hotel industry and government regulators, some meal-sharing platforms are running into trouble.\nIn 2018, Josephine\u2019s Kitchen, a San Francisco-based website created by entrepreneur Charley Wang, shut down partly due to problems with government regulators. \n \u201cAt this point, our team has simply run out of the resources to continue to drive the legislative change, business innovation, and broader cultural shift needed to build this business,\u201d Wang wrote in a statement online.\nLast year, the Maryland House of Delegates passed a bill that allows home cooks to sell \u201ccottage foods\u201d through delivery services or from their homes, special events or farmer\u2019s markets without a license. \nCottage foods include items such as fruit jams, candy, baked goods and a few other products that don\u2019t require refrigeration and aren\u2019t considered a big risk to consumer health. \nHowever, the Maryland Department of Health still prohibits cooks from selling prepared food out of their homes without proper retail licensing. \u201cIf you\u2019re preparing (non-cottage) food to sell, then you have to be licensed,\u201d said Patricia Vauls, chief of the Department\u2019s Office of Food Protection.\nBut so far, the state hasn\u2019t shown much interest in enforcement, in part because meal-sharing, while growing, remains relatively small and goes unnoticed.\n\u201cAs long as this is just the occasional thing with relatively small numbers, the health department doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s all that interested,\u201d said Rob Enderle, a principal at the Enderle Group, a consulting firm that works with the restaurant industry. \n\u201cOnce you reach a critical mass, suddenly the restaurants start complaining,\u201d he said, adding that if people start to get sick from meal-sharing dining, \u201cthere will be investigations, statistics, and FDA regulation.\u201d\nRich Maggiotto, the chief executive of Feastly.com, argues that meal-sharing websites shouldn\u2019t be viewed as competitors to restaurants, but rather as proving grounds and incubators for future restaurants.\n\u201cA lot of times we have chefs that might do a pop-up event that are really looking to raise money for a restaurant, so this is their showcase,\u201d Maggiotto said. He said meal-sharing is also a way for hosts to experiment and to \u201ctest concepts, test new menus, try new things, do something different.\u201d\nFor the home chefs, another reason for working in the gig economy is flexibility. \n\u201cIt\u2019s an easier lifestyle,\u201d said Chris Spear, a personal chef and culinary instructor in Frederick, Maryland. \u201cWhen you think of a traditional chef working 70 or 80 hours a week, working 16-hour-days, getting home at two in the morning\u2026.that\u2019s kind of hard.\u201d \u00a0\nSpear says he works when he wants to work and changes his cuisine depending upon his interest at any given time.\nUnlike Anderson, Spear doesn\u2019t host dinners in his home. Instead, he prepares meals in the homes of his guests or in apartments booked via Airbnb. \n \u201cI\u2019ve started a really cool thing where I\u2019m starting to partner with local Airbnbs,\u201d said Spear, who is also founder of Chefs Without Restaurants, a project that works to connect gig chefs and help them navigate the industry.\nDespite its growing popularity, it\u2019s not clear whether the in-home meal-sharing model will last. Feastly is starting to encourage more chefs to host dinner parties in commercial kitchens and other venues instead of their homes.\nWorking in his cramped galley kitchen during his recent dinner party, Anderson was calm and composed, a skill that comes with years of experience and hours of hustling. It\u2019s a lifestyle he feels is worth pursuing. \n \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to do anything else but cook,\u201d says Anderson, showing off his tattoo with a gleeful smile. \u201cCook or die.\u201d"},

The potential relocation threatens significant financial losses for local businesses that rely on the annual race.", "content": "BALTIMORE \u2013 After nearly 150 years of calling Baltimore home, the Preakness Stakes could be leaving the city in 2021, a move that would take one of the area\u2019s biggest party days of the year \u2013 and a lot of money for the local economy \u2013 along with it. \nNestled in the heart of Charm City\u2019s north side, Pimlico Race Course has hosted the second leg of the Triple Crown since 1873, but could be soon replaced by newer facilities in Laurel. \nThe Stronach Group, owner of the track, has recently expressed concern over the condition of Pimlico and favors the renovated facilities at Laurel Park, a site that the ownership group has been pouring significant money into since 2011. \nLegislation that would shift state funding from Pimlico to Laurel Park is expected to die this week, according to Maryland Matters, but that has not stopped acting Baltimore Mayor Bernard C. \u201cJack\u201d Young from speaking out against the matter. \n \u201cThe biggest thing on my agenda is Pimlico,\u201d Young said at a meeting with state delegates, according to the Baltimore Sun. \n \u201cBaltimore City is going through a very difficult period in its history, with Mayor Catherine Pugh taking a leave of absence for health reasons while simultaneously facing serious allegations into her conduct as an elected official,\u201d Young said in an open letter Wednesday to Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller and House Speaker Michael Busch. \u201cI am writing to you today to ask for your leadership in preventing our city from suffering insult on top of this grave injury.\u201d\nDespite recent pushback from Mayor Catherine Pugh, who sued the Stronach Group last month in attempt to block the move, the departure of Preakness from Baltimore seems increasingly realistic, thus depriving some local bar and restaurant owners of one of their most lucrative weekends of the year. \n\u201cIt would definitely be a hit (to business),\u201d Kelly Rather, owner of Mother\u2019s Grille in the Federal Hill district of Baltimore, told Capital News Service. \u201cIt\u2019s a great day for us and it would be a shame because I think it\u2019s one of the very few events that we have in Baltimore that puts us in a national spotlight.\u201d\nMother\u2019s Grille, in its 21st year of operation in Federal Hill, has emerged as one of the area\u2019s hot spots for pre- and post-race food and drink. \nA partnership with BMORE Around Town, a service that provides transportation to and from Pimlico, has helped make Preakness weekend just as big of a money-maker for the bar as Ravens home games, Orioles Opening Day and St. Patrick\u2019s Day. \n\u201cI would say Friday we probably do 50 percent more (revenue), Sunday we probably do 50 percent more than an average Sunday and then Saturday we do double,\u201d Rather said. \u201c(May) is definitely one of our slower months, so it kind of gives us that jolt for the bartenders and the servers.\u201d\nOperators of other Federal Hill establishments said they reap similar benefits. \nBobby Jones, operations manager of nearby Bandito\u2019s, 101 Deli Bar and Wayward also reported above-average revenue for Preakness race day. \nThe \u201cpregame\u201d and \u201cpostgame\u201d scenes stretch to Fells Point and as far north as Towson, where nearby campus bars and restaurants facilitate the movement of the college-aged crowd to Pimlico.\nTOWSON, Maryland \u2013 The Greene Turtle in Towson, one of the area\u2019s popular bars that benefits from the Preakness Stakes weekend festivities. (Jay Cannon/Capital News Service)\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a big (weekend) and the college kids that are from New Jersey and Texas \u2014 all over \u2014 they stay for that weekend. Because, typically, school\u2019s over. It\u2019s almost like a graduation celebration,\u201d explained Jill Packo, owner and manager of the Greene Turtle in Towson. \u201cDefinitely a huge increase (in revenue) from a typical weekend.\u201d\nPacko said that business at her other Greene Turtle location in Fells Point does even better during Preakness weekend. \nNearby Towson establishment Charles Village Pub and Patio, better known as simply \u201cCVP,\u201d experiences much of the same success on a yearly basis. Owner Rick Bielski estimates CVP brings in roughly 25 percent more revenue for Preakness than on an average weekend.\nTOWSON, Maryland \u2013 Charles Village Pub and Patio, better known as simply \u201cCVP,\u201d where many Preakness Stakes fans celebrate the racing weekend. (Jay Cannon/Capital News Service)\nA move to Laurel Park, located nearly 30 miles south of Pimlico, would cast a cloud of uncertainty over Preakness weekend for many Baltimore-area bars and restaurants. \nThe race would generate nearly $53 million in economic activity annually for the city of Baltimore if it remained in a renovated Pimlico, according to the Baltimore Sun. \nThe move out of the city would entail a significant reduction in attendance capacity, from roughly 130,000 at Pimlico to 75,000-80,000 at Laurel Park. \nThe price of admission likely would increase and there would be no \u201cinfield\u201d scene, which could impact the attendance of college students and young adults that annually pack the large, muddy inner-oval at Pimlico. \nThe infield at Pimlico in recent years has been home to InfieldFest, an annual music festival taking place on the day of Preakness. Artists like Kygo, Diplo and Logic headline the lineup for the 2019 race. \nWould Baltimore hotspots like Federal Hill, Towson and Fells Point still be bustling, lively pregame spots for the race? Would Preakness be more associated with the Washington, D.C. area? Would Preakness still be a draw for young people? These are questions that some bar owners hope they don\u2019t have to answer. \n\u201cDoing it in Laurel, I just feel like it wouldn\u2019t be the same. It\u2019s just always been Pimlico,\u201d said Rather, who said that a move to Laurel Park would likely draw an older crowd. \n\u201cI think (moving) would be a detriment to Preakness,\u201d Packo said. \u201cI don\u2019t think the young kids would go as much if it was moved to Laurel.\u201d\n\u201cI think it would take them years to build that in another area, because it\u2019s too far,\u201d he added. \u201cThere\u2019s too many colleges right here (in Baltimore), there\u2019s too many local places. Other than RJ Bentley\u2019s and the strip right at (the University of) Maryland, I don\u2019t know of the other places that would be a draw.\u201d\nThe move to Laurel would put the Preakness Stakes roughly halfway between Baltimore and the nation\u2019s capital, opening the door for Washington-area bars, restaurants and hotels to step in as hosts for race-goers and tourists. \n\u201cTo be honest with you, I think (the pregame and postgame scene) would probably move down closer to the D.C. area,\u201d Bielski said. \u201cI think when people come in town for the Preakness, they get hotels around the area and kind of filter down into the city and up through Towson. I don\u2019t think that would be the case if it did go to Laurel. I think the whole package would move more south.\u201d\nNot all bar owners share this same sentiment, though. \nJones, whose three establishments are some of the more popular bars in the Federal Hill area, believes the draw of the race will be enough to stir up crowds, both at Laurel Park and his bars and restaurants. \n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to deter people,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are still going to go to Preakness. People are still going to party. People are still going to catch their Ubers.\u201d \n\u201cPeople are getting caught up in the nostalgia of Pimlico,\u201d Jones continued. \u201cIt\u2019s still going to be the Preakness Stakes. Whether it\u2019s in Harford County or whether it\u2019s in Howard County, I still think that people are gonna go.\u201d\nThe race is scheduled to take place at Pimlico in 2019 and 2020, which would mark the 150th anniversary of the course\u2019s opening in 1870. \nBeyond then, however, the future of Preakness at Pimlico will be dictated by a political battle between the Stronach Group and the city of Baltimore. It would reportedly require a cost of $424 million to renovate Pimlico and keep the race there, according to a recent study. \n\u201cThis is a gem for our city,\u201d Pugh said of Preakness last month. \u201cIt is an economic generator. It is part of our history.\u201d\nPugh has since taken what her office called an \u201cindefinite leave of absence,\u201d citing pneumonia as the reason. But the leave came amidst a brewing scandal over possible financial improprieties in connection with a book she authored."},

She\u2019s had three heart attacks in 10 years. Her COPD makes it difficult to breathe, so she has an oxygen tank by her side day and night. \nIf she could, she would move clean out of the city, Ford says, but she doesn\u2019t have the money.

She could try to sell her house but, even if she could find a buyer, she likely wouldn\u2019t get more than $15,000 for it, the value assessed by the state. That would be enough cash to rent a new place for a while, but probably not enough to purchase a better house. \nIn 2015, about half of all households in Southwest Baltimore had an income of less than $25,000 a year, according to BNIA data, and nearly 28 percent of the 8,252 residential properties in the area were vacant and abandoned. \nFord lives on a monthly Social Security check of $488.67 and has no money to fix up her house \u2014 let alone move to Wyoming. With  her health problems, she can\u2019t work and rarely leaves her house.\nShe can walk a few steps at a time, but she generally uses a wheelchair, even inside her home.

She calls a taxi cab to take her there and rides a motorized scooter to get around the store. Sometimes, if a task is small enough, she says, she calls on her neighbors to run errands for her. \nThe Carrollton Ridge area originated as a German immigrant community. The first homes went up in the 1870s.  Work in nearby factories was plentiful.  \nToday, the area is depressed and BNIA data reports a 2015 unemployment rate of almost 16 percent \u2014 three times greater than the national average that year. Most of the factories are gone. The remaining jobs are largely in fast-food restaurants and stores in the Westside Shopping Center. \nOn South Smallwood Street, the sky-blue color of Ford\u2019s front door pops next to the 10 other doors on her block. Six of those houses are vacant, and four of those vacants are boarded up with plywood that is gray with age. \nWith so many vacancies, people from nearby neighborhoods regularly drive through the alleys and use Carrollton Ridge as a dumping site for their own trash. \nTrash has become one of the biggest, most visible problems in Carrollton Ridge, and Ford knows that its presence isn\u2019t good for anyone\u2019s health because it attracts unwanted mice and roaches that eventually creep into houses. \n\u201cThe trash is worse than the drugs,\u201d Ford says. \u201cThe man next door, he\u2019ll get out there and clean the streets, all the way up and down. I said [to him], \u2018You\u2019re doing a thankless job.\u2019 \u201d\nEmpty cans, bottles, food wrappers, couches, mattresses, other furniture, and unidentifiable pieces of plastic and fabric make up the trash that is scattered widely across many of the streets and sidewalks. Many of the trash piles resemble those that would be found at city dumps, with debris and waste piled 6-feet high in some places. \nWith the unwanted trash come the unwelcome pests.\nPointing down between her knees at Sarge, the plump, sometimes irritable 11-year-old dachshund sitting between her ankles,  Ford says, \u201cThat\u2019s the mouse killer right there.\u201d\nSarge has killed about 400 mice over his lifetime and Ford says she hasn\u2019t spotted a mouse for nearly four months. \nBut Ford says the roaches are worse than the mice. They come into her home when her neighbor in the next rowhouse, whom she shares a wall with, sprays bug repellant. To combat the bugs, she uses Sevin, a bug killer designed strictly for outdoor use.\n\u201cI throw the [Sevin] dust around and it kind of tames them down and sends them back where they came from,\u201d Ford says. The roaches \u201ccome on over here, and I run them back.\u201d \nSevin is a garden pesticide.  The labeling on Sevin products stress that the dust is not meant for indoor use, to use extreme caution when using it, and especially to avoid contact with bare skin.\nFord says she knows that the Sevin dust she has used for years is not considered safe for indoor use, but that doesn\u2019t worry her.\n\u201cAnything and everything you use is going to be against you,\u201d Ford said. \u201cI\u2019ve used that stuff since I was 16 years old.\u201d\nWhen Ford has a doctor\u2019s appointment, Bon Secours Hospital provides free transportation with a shuttle that picks her up, takes her to their primary care facility on West Baltimore Street, and then drops her off at her front steps by the end of the day. \nOtherwise, Ford stays home. She says she spends her days watching Westerns  and horror flicks on TV while making designs out of yarn on plastic canvas, in a rowhouse decorated with fading paintings of wide-open spaces."},

Work in nearby factories was plentiful.  \nToday, the area is depressed and BNIA data reports a 2015 unemployment rate of almost 16 percent \u2014 three times greater than the national average that year. Most of the factories are gone. The remaining jobs are largely in fast-food restaurants and stores in the Westside Shopping Center. \nOn South Smallwood Street, the sky-blue color of Ford\u2019s front door pops next to the 10 other doors on her block. Six of those houses are vacant, and four of those vacants are boarded up with plywood that is gray with age. \nWith so many vacancies, people from nearby neighborhoods regularly drive through the alleys and use Carrollton Ridge as a dumping site for their own trash. \nTrash has become one of the biggest, most visible problems in Carrollton Ridge, and Ford knows that its presence isn\u2019t good for anyone\u2019s health because it attracts unwanted mice and roaches that eventually creep into houses. \n\u201cThe trash is worse than the drugs,\u201d Ford says. \u201cThe man next door, he\u2019ll get out there and clean the streets, all the way up and down. I said [to him], \u2018You\u2019re doing a thankless job.\u2019 \u201d\nEmpty cans, bottles, food wrappers, couches, mattresses, other furniture, and unidentifiable pieces of plastic and fabric make up the trash that is scattered widely across many of the streets and sidewalks. Many of the trash piles resemble those that would be found at city dumps, with debris and waste piled 6-feet high in some places. \nWith the unwanted trash come the unwelcome pests.\nPointing down between her knees at Sarge, the plump, sometimes irritable 11-year-old dachshund sitting between her ankles,  Ford says, \u201cThat\u2019s the mouse killer right there.\u201d\nSarge has killed about 400 mice over his lifetime and Ford says she hasn\u2019t spotted a mouse for nearly four months. \nBut Ford says the roaches are worse than the mice. They come into her home when her neighbor in the next rowhouse, whom she shares a wall with, sprays bug repellant. To combat the bugs, she uses Sevin, a bug killer designed strictly for outdoor use.\n\u201cI throw the [Sevin] dust around and it kind of tames them down and sends them back where they came from,\u201d Ford says. The roaches \u201ccome on over here, and I run them back.\u201d\nSevin is a garden pesticide.  The labeling on Sevin products stress that the dust is not meant for indoor use, to use extreme caution when using it, and especially to avoid contact with bare skin.\nFord says she knows that the Sevin dust she has used for years is not considered safe for indoor use, but that doesn\u2019t worry her.\n\u201cAnything and everything you use is going to be against you,\u201d Ford said. \u201cI\u2019ve used that stuff since I was 16 years old.\u201d\nWhen Ford has a doctor\u2019s appointment, Bon Secours Hospital provides free transportation with a shuttle that picks her up, takes her to their primary care facility on West Baltimore Street, and then drops her off at her front steps by the end of the day. \nOtherwise, Ford stays home. She says she spends her days watching Westerns  and horror flicks on TV while making designs out of yarn on plastic canvas, in a rowhouse decorated with fading paintings of wide-open spaces."},

Fundaci\u00f3n Janet Arce helped secure housing and employment, with a landlord delaying renovations to accommodate them immediately.", "content": "BALTIMORE \u2013 The Tavarez family struggled through a harrowing month and a half after Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico, living in their San Juan neighborhood without power, scrambling to buy necessities and driving in streets without functioning traffic lights.\nAfter Evelyn Tavarez, a mother of three, had a near-death experience in a car accident, she and her husband decided to buy plane tickets to Washington.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what pushed me to the possibility of leaving for the United States,\u201d Tavarez told Capital News Service in Spanish on the day of her arrival at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Washington. \u201cBut believe me, I bought the tickets and did not know where I was going to end up.\u201d\n\nThree-and-a-half weeks ago, with the help of a charity, the family arrived in Baltimore.\nBack in devastated Puerto Rico, Tavarez started contacting organizations through Facebook, looking for housing assistance and employment resources in the continental United States. One of the page administrators connected Tavarez to Fundaci\u00f3n Janet Arce, a charity based in Baltimore that has taken on the task of helping Puerto Rican families relocate to Baltimore.\nAfter hearing Tavarez\u2019s story, Janet Arce, the charity\u2019s founder, told Tavarez that she would try to find a house for her and her family, as well as employment for her and her husband (he asked not to be identified for this story, citing privacy reasons). Arce is currently helping four Puerto Rican families move and settle in to Baltimore.\nDawn Marie Jones, Arce\u2019s friend and a landlord, owns a brick house with her husband in northern Baltimore, whose tenants had moved out recently.\nJones agreed to rent out the house to hurricane-stricken Puerto Ricans coming to Maryland. The second floor of the two-level house went to the Tavarez family, who were also given the opportunity to pay off the security deposit on a month-by-month basis. Jones put off making renovations to the apartments so they would be available right away.\n\u201cI spoke to my husband and said \u2018You know, these families are coming in now and if we can help them now with a lower rent\u2019\u2014because once I do the work that I plan to do, obviously, the rent will be higher,\u201d Jones said.\nAfter more than two weeks in the United States, Tavarez\u2019s husband has not been able to find a job, even though the family moved to Baltimore relying on Arce\u2019s assurances that they would have jobs lined up quickly upon arriving. Tavarez has been looking for other job resources and social services, but has problems affording transportation.\n\u201cBecause he is not working, we don\u2019t have enough money to be taking buses from one place to another,\u201d Tavarez said.\nThe Tavarez\u2019s rent is due on December 15. At the moment, the landlord said she does not have plans to extend the payment deadline.\nArce is helping the family connect with job opportunities through Barry Graham, latino engagement specialist at Goodwill Industries of the Chesapeake, Inc.\n\u201cThe biggest challenge we\u2019re going to have is the English.\u201d Graham said. \u201cWhat I\u2019ll probably do is, I can get them registered right here in Baltimore with Baltimore City Community College.\u201d\nArce would consider the possibility of organizing a fundraiser for the family, in case they are unable to pay rent, she said.\n\u201cIn any case, if something were to be done, we\u2019re going to ask people to donate money directly to them,\u201d Arce told Capital News Service in Spanish.\nTavarez, her husband and three kids, arrived Nov. 11. They were met by a volunteer from the Arce\u2019s charity who took them to their new Baltimore home, which was furnished with the help of local volunteers.\nJean Edwards, a retired education and training specialist from the University of Maryland, Baltimore, was one of the volunteers painting the apartment and collecting food and furniture. She was there on the first day to greet the family and help move a couch into the house.\n\u201cOur goal was to have a month of food so they wouldn\u2019t have to go shopping and worry about that while they\u2019re getting the children in school and looking for work,\u201d Edwards said.\nOne her last day in Puerto Rico, Evelyn Tavarez wanted her father to say goodbye to her at the airport.\n\u201cIt looks like it was going to be too tough,\u201d Tavarez said.\nInstead, she said her farewell to him the day before her travels.\n\u201cHe advised me a lot to move to the United States, that the kids were going to be better off, that in Puerto Rico, with the crime and the schools not giving classes, they were not going to be fine,\u201d Tavarez said."},
