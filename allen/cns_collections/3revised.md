# Baltimore Beat Guide: A Sports Reporter's Introduction to Maryland's Major City

## Welcome to Charm City

Look, I get it—you've covered the Ravens, maybe the Orioles, but now you're diving into the actual city of Baltimore. This isn't just about sports anymore. You're stepping into a complex urban landscape with deep-rooted challenges, resilient communities, and stories that matter way beyond the box score. Think of this as your playbook for understanding the territory.

## The Key Players You Need to Know

**Brandon Scott** is your current mayor—young, energetic, and dealing with some serious fourth-quarter challenges. He took office in 2020 and has been pushing hard on violence reduction programs. When you're covering city issues, his office is your first call.

**Wes Moore** is the governor, and he's got Baltimore on his radar in a big way. The "Reinvest Baltimore" initiative targeting vacant properties? That's his play. He's also been visible during crises like the Key Bridge collapse.

**Freedom Jones** runs violence intervention programs for the Lifebridge Health Center for Hope, which administers the Safe Streets program. If you're doing anything on crime reduction, this is your guy. The program operates in specific zones—think of them like franchises across the city.

**The Late Elijah Cummings** still casts a long shadow. His legacy shapes how people talk about trauma, healing, and what Baltimore could be. The Elijah Cummings Healing City Act requires city workers to get trauma training—that's how much his influence persists.

## The Big Issues: Your Beat Breakdown

### Violence and Crime (The Lead Story)

Baltimore's violence problem is like covering a team in a decades-long losing streak—except people are dying. Here's what you need to know:

- **Safe Streets Program**: This is the city's MVP for violence prevention. Think public health approach, not just more cops. They work in 10 specific zones representing about 3% of the city. Four zones run through Catholic Charities, six through Lifebridge Health Center for Hope. ([https://cnsmaryland.org/2025/05/08/after-a-historic-2024-a-baltimore-violence-prevention-program-is-in-peril/](https://cnsmaryland.org/2025/05/08/after-a-historic-2024-a-baltimore-violence-prevention-program-is-in-peril/))

- **The Numbers**: In 2024, Baltimore saw four Safe Streets zones go a full year without homicides. That's historic. April 2025 had just five homicides—the lowest monthly count in recorded history. But here's the catch: federal funding cuts from the Trump administration threaten the whole operation. They lost $1.2 million, which is 10% of Center for Hope's budget.

- **The Squeegee Worker Situation**: This has been contentious for 30+ years. Kids clean windshields at intersections for cash. Some see hustle, others see a nuisance. After the 2023 murder of Timothy Reynolds by a 15-year-old squeegee worker, the city created anti-panhandling zones and offered workforce training programs. **NOTE**: Check current status—this was ongoing policy debate. ([https://cnsmaryland.org/2022/11/10/baltimore-city-reveals-plan-for-controversial-squeegee-workers/](https://cnsmaryland.org/2022/11/10/baltimore-city-reveals-plan-for-controversial-squeegee-workers/))

### The Key Bridge Collapse (March 26, 2024)

This was Baltimore's 9/11 moment. A container ship hit the Francis Scott Key Bridge, killing six construction workers. Here's your essential background:

- The ship sounded a mayday call, allowing officials to divert traffic—probably saved countless lives
- The Port of Baltimore closed completely, threatening 51,000 jobs
- Governor Moore approved $60 million in temporary assistance
- The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers cleared the channel in 77 days (they thought it'd take three months)
- A Johns Hopkins survey found about half of Baltimoreans felt their daily lives were disrupted
- The city largely avoided the economic catastrophe everyone feared, thanks to fast federal response, state emergency assistance, and community resilience

**The Rebuild**: New bridge design unveiled February 2025, scheduled completion Fall 2028, federal government covering the estimated $2 billion cost. The new bridge deck will be 45 feet taller. ([https://cnsmaryland.org/2025/03/24/key-bridge-baltimore-averted-crisis/](https://cnsmaryland.org/2025/03/24/key-bridge-baltimore-averted-crisis/))

### Housing and Vacancy Crisis

This is probably the toughest story to tell. Baltimore has roughly 13,000 vacant and abandoned homes, plus 20,000 vacant lots. To put that in sports terms: imagine if every third stadium seat was broken and nobody fixed it for decades.

**The "Reinvest Baltimore" Program**: Governor Moore's executive order calls for transforming at least 5,000 vacant properties into homes or businesses over five years. Jake Day (Secretary of Housing & Community Development) chairs the council overseeing this. **CAVEAT**: This is ambitious and long-term—check progress, but don't expect immediate results. ([https://cnsmaryland.org/2024/10/02/gov-moore-takes-aim-at-baltimores-vacant-properties/](https://cnsmaryland.org/2024/10/02/gov-moore-takes-aim-at-baltimores-vacant-properties/))

**Sewage Backup Disaster**: Here's an underreported angle—Baltimore's century-old sewer system causes thousands of sewage backups in homes annually. The city has a reimbursement program (up to $5,000), but between April 2018 and March 2021, only 19 out of 120 applications were approved. That's a 16% success rate. Residents reported more than 18,700 backups during that same period. The eligibility requirements are Byzantine—if inspectors find *anything* blocking the line (even a stick), your claim gets denied, even if there was two inches of rain. ([https://cnsmaryland.org/2021/05/11/baltimore-reimbursement-program-leaves-residents-burdened-with-sewage-backup-costs/](https://cnsmaryland.org/2021/05/11/baltimore-reimbursement-program-leaves-residents-burdened-with-sewage-backup-costs/))

### Juvenile Crime and Youth Issues

While overall crime decreased, juvenile crime remains a problem. Vincent Schiraldi, Department of Juvenile Services Secretary, faced calls for removal from politicians and residents in 2024. **NOTE**: Check his current status—this was an active political issue. ([https://cnsmaryland.org/2024/11/15/local-baltimore-residents-and-politicians-call-for-change-as-juvenile-crime-remains-high/](https://cnsmaryland.org/2024/11/15/local-baltimore-residents-and-politicians-call-for-change-as-juvenile-crime-remains-high/))

**The Healing City Act**: This is actually innovative policy. Following the 2019 shooting at Frederick Douglass High School, three students (Jaionna Santos, Bryonna Harris, Damani Thomas) testified before City Council about growing up with trauma. Their testimony helped push through the Elijah Cummings Healing City Act, signed into law February 2020. It mandates trauma training for ALL city employees—cops, teachers, rec center staff, everyone. The idea: recognize trauma and respond with help, not punishment. ([https://cnsmaryland.org/2020/06/17/three-students-accepted-violence-in-their-lives-until-a-shooting-in-their-school/](https://cnsmaryland.org/2020/06/17/three-students-accepted-violence-in-their-lives-until-a-shooting-in-their-school/))

### Economic Inequality and Neighborhoods

Baltimore is a tale of two cities—sometimes three or four. Understanding the geography matters:

**The Divides**: 
- **Mondawmin vs. Bolton Hill**: Walk two miles and you go from 14% vacancy rate to 1%, from $24,625 per capita income to $45,263. This isn't accident—it's the legacy of redlining and decades of disinvestment. ([https://cnsmaryland.org/2022/12/15/baltimore-neighborhoods-mondawmin-bolton-hill-face-different-realities-due-to-citys-history/](https://cnsmaryland.org/2022/12/15/baltimore-neighborhoods-mondawmin-bolton-hill-face-different-realities-due-to-citys-history/))

- **Old Town vs. Little Italy**: Old Town has per capita income around $12,100 (below federal poverty line). Walk to Little Italy and it's $65,834—more than five times higher. ([https://cnsmaryland.org/2022/12/15/old-town-residents-see-paycheck-shrink-while-neighbors-thrive/](https://cnsmaryland.org/2022/12/15/old-town-residents-see-paycheck-shrink-while-neighbors-thrive/))

**Sandtown-Winchester**: This is where Freddie Gray was from. It's 74 square blocks with 109 places to buy liquor and exactly zero grocery stores. About half of residents ages 16-64 were employed in 2018. Rev. Derrick DeWitt at First Mount Calvary Baptist Church runs food distribution six days a week here—they fed 18,000+ people between May and October 2020. ([https://cnsmaryland.org/2020/12/17/volunteers-are-working-harder-as-covid-heightens-the-need-for-food/](https://cnsmaryland.org/2020/12/17/volunteers-are-working-harder-as-covid-heightens-the-need-for-food/))

## Key Institutions: Your Sources

### Government
- **Baltimore City Council**: Obviously essential. President is your first call.
- **Baltimore Police Department**: Crime stats, policy changes. Commissioner reports to the mayor.
- **Maryland Department of Transportation**: Anything infrastructure-related, especially post-Key Bridge.
- **Department of Environment**: Permits, environmental issues, development.

### Community Organizations
- **Lifebridge Health Center for Hope**: Violence intervention, the largest street intervention program of any hospital in the country.
- **Maryland Food Bank**: Food insecurity stories. Distribution rate increased 96% from March-October 2020 compared to prior year.
- **Fight Blight Bmore** (Nneka N'namdi): Vacancy issues, property concerns. She's authentic and data-driven.
- **The Nolita Project** (Wesley Hawkins): Youth mentoring, particularly for at-risk teens. He's been at this since 2012.

### Academic/Research
- **Baltimore Neighborhood Indicators Alliance (BNIA)**: This is your stat sheet. They track everything by neighborhood—vacancy rates, crime, income, education. Essential for any neighborhood story.
- **Johns Hopkins University**: Multiple research centers studying Baltimore issues. Also operates hospitals that partner with violence prevention programs.
- **Morgan State University**: Historically Black university, deeply embedded in the community.

## Practical Implications: How to Actually Cover This Beat

### Story Ideas & Undercovered Angles

**Violence Prevention Funding Crisis** (**URGENT/ONGOING**): 
The Safe Streets program lost federal funding but achieved historic crime reduction in 2024. This is a ticking clock story. What happens if funding isn't restored? Track the zones that went homicide-free—will that continue? Interview Emanuel Tarrant-Bey (Belvedere site director) or Freedom Jones. **Potential angle**: Compare costs of incarceration vs. prevention programs.

**Sewage Backup Victims** (**INVESTIGATIVE POTENTIAL**):
Only 16% approval rate for reimbursement claims despite thousands of backups yearly? Follow families dealing with repeated backups. The S.O.S. Cleanup Program launched March 2023—how's that working? **NOTE**: Check if there have been any policy changes or lawsuits since 2021 reporting.

**Key Bridge Economic Impact—One Year Later** (**ANNIVERSARY/FOLLOW-UP**):
The bridge collapsed March 26, 2024. At the one-year mark, how are businesses really doing? The initial reporting focused on avoiding catastrophe, but dig deeper into specific business sectors—trucking companies, tourism-dependent businesses, commuters' quality of life. Interview the Mutinda family (they got reimbursed) and Rachel Mutinda about whether recovery assistance was sufficient.

**Tax Sale System** (**INVESTIGATIVE**):
Low-income homeowners, especially African Americans, are losing homes through Baltimore's tax sale system. It functions like liens being auctioned to private investors at 18% interest. Raymond Thompson nearly lost his home but paid it off through a benefactor—most aren't that lucky. Amy Hennen at Maryland Volunteer Lawyers Service is your source. **ONGOING**: Check status of HB252 (deferred owner-occupied properties from tax sales 2021-2023). ([https://cnsmaryland.org/2021/03/26/baltimore-city-residents-press-for-tax-sale-relief/](https://cnsmaryland.org/2021/03/26/baltimore-city-residents-press-for-tax-sale-relief/))

**"Smalltimore" Business Community** (**FEATURE**):
Bobby LaPin (Boat Baltimore, Port Covington) summed it up: "Small businesses in Baltimore exist, despite the bureaucracy and all the red tape, and they exist because people in Baltimore love Baltimore." Explore the tight-knit small business network, how they support each other. Christina Brunyate (Domesticity fabric shop in Lauraville) said she "chose to open a business in the same place I live because I am involved here and I want to invest in my neighborhood." **Angle**: Profile business owners who stayed through the Freddie Gray unrest and COVID. ([https://cnsmaryland.org/2024/05/08/about_smalltimore/](https://cnsmaryland.org/2024/05/08/about_smalltimore/))

**Mondawmin Mall Development** (**DEVELOPMENT/FOLLOW-UP**):
Tim Regan (CEO of Whiting-Turner) purchased the former Target site in 2022, launching "The Village at Mondawmin." Four confirmed tenants as of March 2023. Hub City Brewery opening late 2023/early 2024. $20 million federal grant for Mondawmin transit hub improvements. **Check current status**—has this investment materialized? Are property values changing? Interview Mario Chang (Gera Variety Discount Liquors) about what he's seeing. ([https://cnsmaryland.org/2024/05/08/mondawmin-small-business/](https://cnsmaryland.org/2024/05/08/mondawmin-small-business/))

**Child Care Desert** (**ONGOING CRISIS**):
Baltimore City lost 15.64% of child care providers between 2020-2024 (from 793 to 669). That's 124 providers gone. Baltimore County lost 18.16% of providers in same period. Yvonne Turner at Old Mother Hubbard's Child Care Center said regulations around infant care (under age 2) make it especially hard. Many single mothers rely on neighborhood-based providers. **Story idea**: Shadow a family trying to find affordable child care, or profile providers like LaKesha Solomon (Solomon's Family Daycare) who've been in neighborhoods for 25+ years. ([https://cnsmaryland.org/2024/06/25/child-care-in-baltimore-city/](https://cnsmaryland.org/2024/06/25/child-care-in-baltimore-city/))

**Barbershops as Healthcare Hubs**:
Troy Staton's New Beginnings barbershop in Hollins Market partners with Kaiser Permanente to provide blood pressure checks, HIV testing, flu shots. Six other barbershops/salons are partners. Mental Health First Aid certification for all partners. This addresses the stigma against mental health in African American communities. **Angle**: How effective are these partnerships? Has Kaiser measured health outcomes? Profile clients who've gotten help they wouldn't have sought elsewhere. Staton himself was shot in his shop on Halloween 2018—he keeps the bullet hole in the wall as a reminder. ([https://cnsmaryland.org/2020/06/17/baltimore-barbershops-help-clients-cope-with-citys-senseless-violence/](https://cnsmaryland.org/2020/06/17/baltimore-barbershops-help-clients-cope-with-citys-senseless-violence/))

### Checklist for Any Baltimore Neighborhood Story

- **Get the BNIA data**: Vacancy rate, median income, crime stats, demographics
- **Check the redlining history**: Many current disparities trace directly to 20th-century discrimination
- **Identify community anchors**: Churches, rec centers, corner stores—who are the connectors?
- **Talk to longtime residents AND newcomers**: You need both perspectives
- **Visit at different times**: Morning, afternoon, evening. A neighborhood can feel completely different
- **Ask about the "before and after"**: Freddie Gray unrest (2015), COVID, Key Bridge collapse—these are markers
- **Don't just parachute in for the crime story**: People are tired of only seeing their neighborhoods when something bad happens

### Navigating the Political Landscape

Baltimore is overwhelmingly Democratic (10-to-1 over Republicans). In 2016, 85% voted for Hillary Clinton. The last Republican mayor was Theodore R. McKeldin in 1963. So when you're covering elections or policy, understand that most political battles happen in Democratic primaries, not general elections.

**The Catherine Pugh Saga**: Former mayor pleaded guilty in 2019 to fraud involving "Healthy Holly" children's books—she fraudulently sold 132,116 copies to organizations doing business with the city/state for $859,960. Got three years in federal prison. This still shapes how Baltimoreans view political corruption and trust in government. ([https://cnsmaryland.org/2020/02/27/ex-baltimore-mayor-gets-three-years-for-healthy-holly-fraud/](https://cnsmaryland.org/2020/02/27/ex-baltimore-mayor-gets-three-years-for-healthy-holly-fraud/))

**Trump's Shadow**: In July 2019, President Trump called Baltimore a "disgusting, rat- and rodent-infested mess" while attacking Rep. Elijah Cummings. People remember. When Wes Moore and Dan Cox handed out water during the E. coli outbreak in 2022, Emanuel Holley (35, West Baltimore) said his vote was motivated by wanting "to see Trump out of office." This still matters politically. ([https://cnsmaryland.org/2022/09/08/gubernatorial-candidates-hand-out-water-in-baltimore-neighborhoods-affected-by-e-coli-contamination/](https://cnsmaryland.org/2022/09/08/gubernatorial-candidates-hand-out-water-in-baltimore-neighborhoods-affected-by-e-coli-contamination/))

### Sources You Should Cultivate

**Government/Political:**
- Mayor Brandon Scott's office
- City Council President
- Gov. Wes Moore's Baltimore liaisons
- Police Commissioner

**Community Leaders:**
- Rev. Derrick DeWitt (First Mount Calvary Baptist Church, Sandtown-Winchester)
- Freedom Jones (Center for Hope)
- Nneka N'namdi (Fight Blight Bmore)
- Wesley Hawkins (The Nolita Project)
- Zeke Cohen (City Councilman, former teacher, sponsored Healing City Act)

**Experts/Academics:**
- Seema Iyer (formerly BNIA, now with UN High Commission for Refugees—but still knowledgeable about Baltimore data)
- Philip Leaf (Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, sits on My Brother's Keeper Baltimore board)
- Michael Sinclair (Morgan State University School of Social Work)

**Business/Economic:**
- Debra Keller-Greene (Greater Baltimore Black Chamber of Commerce)
- Dan Spedden (Hagerstown/Washington County Convention and Visitors Bureau—for anything Port-related)
- Small business owners in various neighborhoods (your grassroots economic indicators)

## Timeline Awareness: Key Moments That Still Matter

- **2015**: Freddie Gray dies in police custody (April 19), unrest follows. This is still a reference point for everything.
- **2018**: Catherine Pugh's Healthy Holly scandal begins, Safe Streets reimbursement program launches (April)
- **2019**: Frederick Douglass High School shooting (Feb. 8), students testify to City Council (April 10), Elijah Cummings dies (Oct. 17), Pugh indicted (Nov. 20)
- **2020**: Elijah Cummings Healing City Act signed (February), Brandon Scott elected mayor, COVID hits
- **2024**: Key Bridge collapse (March 26), historic violence reduction achieved in Safe Streets zones
- **2025**: Federal funding cuts threaten Safe Streets program (ongoing)

## The Reality Check: What This Beat Requires

You're used to covering wins and losses with clear outcomes. This beat doesn't work that way. Progress is measured in decades, not quarters. A neighborhood going a year without a homicide is a championship season. A family getting reimbursed for sewage damage is a win.

**Things that will frustrate you:**
- Policy debates that drag on for years
- Data that's always 1-2 years behind
- Promised initiatives that never materialize
- Sources who've been burned by media before
- No simple heroes or villains

**Things that will surprise you:**
- The resilience—people like Dawn Ford (Carrollton Ridge homeowner, multiple health issues, $488/month Social Security) who keep going
- The grassroots innovation—Wesley Hawkins turning trauma into youth mentorship, Troy Staton turning his barbershop into a healthcare access point
- The tight community bonds—Carolyn Anewich (Soul Kitchen) cooking gourmet meals for 50-100 people weekly, unpaid, because "people need food"
- How intercon nected everything is—violence affects housing, housing affects education, education affects employment, employment affects health

## Final Word: Don't Be That Reporter

You know the type—parachutes in for the crime story, films the boarded-up houses, interviews people only when something terrible happens, then disappears. Baltimore has had enough of that.

The best stories here come from showing up consistently, building relationships, and understanding that every negative statistic represents a person trying to navigate impossible circumstances. Yeah, there's poverty, crime, and dysfunction. There's also Chef Malik Anderson serving eight-course gourmet meals from his home for $86 a person, Kelly Rajahpillay at the Presbyterian Church saying "our town is in dire need of realigning itself," and thousands of people who just want their city to work.

Approach this like covering a rebuilding team—respect the history, acknowledge the current struggles, but don't write off the future. And remember what Bobby LaPin said: Baltimore businesses "exist, despite the bureaucracy and all the red tape, and they exist because people in Baltimore love Baltimore."

That's your story. Go find it.

---

*Note: Many of these stories involve ongoing policy debates, lawsuits, or development projects. Always check current status before reporting. Baltimore changes fast—sometimes for better, often for worse, occasionally sideways.*
