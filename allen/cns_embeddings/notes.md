cns_embeddings 09/24/25

My initial reaction to the embeddings visualization was confusion, it appeared chaotic and overwhelming. However, once I zoomed in for a closer look, I found the model quite impressive. What particularly struck me was how effectively it grouped stories by topic and theme.
When I clicked on the College Park cluster, I received highly focused local news specific to that area. Similarly, clicking on election-related content labeled as "election-vote-democratic" returned stories that were clearly written from a Democratic perspective or viewpoint. The sports cluster and police/Maryland law embeddings also formed substantial groupings, indicating these are major coverage areas.
Several patterns emerged from this analysis. The data reveals that CNS covers significant amounts of political news, suggesting they would benefit from dedicated tags for elections, bills, healthcare, and education. Overall, the embeddings provide valuable insight into CNS as a news organization: they clearly focus on Maryland local and state government coverage, and there appears to be a strong connection to College Park, Maryland, which could show someone that this may be their geographic starting point or headquarters.
I found the embedding approach particularly compelling as a method for potientally organizing archived content. This visualization showed me how large volumes of news stories can be meaningfully clustered in order to make searchable content, transforming what could be an unwieldy archive into an topic-based discovery system.
