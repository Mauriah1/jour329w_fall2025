CNS Topic Analysis 10/04/25

Although I didnt have access to my prior project, I did observe a few things about the CNS website. One of those insights surrounding political coverage, political coverage appears most frequently, and it often focuses on government decisions, community impacts, and issues tied to law, public safety, or health. Maryland-specific topics that come up repeatedly include housing, the economy, Governor Wes Mooreâ€™s policies and opinions, education, and legislative measures, many of which are framed in terms of unmet expectations or disappointing outcomes. At the same time, politics as a whole feels overrepresented in the topic list, with multiple overlapping categories centered on governance and policy, which can overshadow other important areas of coverage. Underrepresented are stories that highlight positive developments within Maryland communities, as well as feature-driven or human-interest reporting. Crime coverage also appears limited, especially outside of broader policy or law enforcement contexts.

Revised List 
1. Agriculture, Food and Animals : I combinded the first two topics because Argiculcture and food go hand to hand with animal awarneness. Even in the description it hints to Agricultural policy which often includes livestock and wildlife management, so it makes sense to keep them under one topic.
2. Arts, Culture and History : I combined these three because all deal with heritage, cultural resources, public funding for the humanities, and how societies express and or remember themselves.
3. Civil Rights, Justice and Law (Originals : Native Americans, Civil Rights, Justice and Law): All of these descriptions focused on legal systems, rights, and enforcement.
4. Commerce, Economy and Trade : All describe financial flows, business, and regulation.
5. Congress and Federal Politics : Both cover U.S. federal governance and institutions.
6. Maryland Politics (Originial - Maryland Governement and Poltics, + Baltimore) : I decided to keep this one mostly separate due to the specific state-level focus and I decided to add Baltimore becasue it could be a sub-tag for this category. I also shorten the name, just due to wordiness. 
7. Defense, Security and Emergency Management (Originial - Armed Forces and National Security + Emergency Management): Both focus on national defense and crisis response and I also shorten the name due to the wordiness of the tags. 
8. Education : I also decided to keep this one on its own because its a pretty distinct topic and can stand alone. 
9. Elections and Campaigns: Thinique focus on campaigns, different from governance.
10. Energy, Environment and Natural Resources (Originials - Energy + Environmental Protection + Natural Resources + Chesapeake Bay) : They all describe management of natural systems and environmental policy.
11. Families, Health and Social Welfare :I combined all of these topics because all of these topics center on human well-being and social policy.
12. Housing & Urban Development (Original - Housing) : I decided to keep this topic as standalone because I think it is distinct enought. However I added Urban Development because the stories all related to some type of urban development, while addressing the pros and cons of this. 
13. Immigration and International Affairs : I decided to add these two topics together because they both address refugees, visas, and diplomacy overlap. In my eyes immigration is inherently international.
14. Labor and Employment: I combined these two together because both are workforce-specific. 
15. Science, Technology and Sports : I combined both of these together because both describe performance, innovation, and human achievement, grouped for balance in a condensed list.
